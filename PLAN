================

Updated: 04 Mar 2016 12:00:58 PST

Planned work in rough order
===========================

* Glue code for WG issue trackers and wiki:
  - create new trackers on group creation
  - update access lists on group chair/secretary changes
  - update components on new group documents

* Schema changes: Person.bio and Person.photo

* Add "Waiting for implementation" and "Held by WG" states, with comment field

* Schema Changes: floorplan, document tags, external links for groups

* Modified account creation, with safeguards against spammer accounts

* Interim meeting management project merge

* Glue code to trigger generation of htmlized documents on www.ietf.org

* Review tracking project merge

* Upgrade to Django 1.8 / 1.9

* Meeting materials enhancements

* Transition to PostgreSQL

* Performance analysis of database table and index setup

* Code refactoring to avoid code changes for new WG document tags

* When draft XML source is available, take references from that instead
  of extracting them from the text version.

* Small nomcom refactoring: associate Feedback records with Person
  instead of User.

* Consistency fix:  in settings.py, name directory settings consistently with
  ..._DIR; reserving ..._PATH for settings with PATH semantics (':'-separated lists
  of directories)
