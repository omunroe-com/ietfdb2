  - update components on new group documents

* Add "Waiting for implementation" and "Held by WG" states, with comment field

* Glue code to trigger generation of htmlized documents on www.ietf.org

* Refactored Community app

* Schema Changes: floorplan, document tags, external links for groups

* Transition to PostgreSQL

* Performance analysis of database table and index setup

* Code refactoring to avoid code changes for new WG document tags

  of extracting them from the text version.
