This is the "facelift" datatracker branch that uses Twitter Bootstrap for
the UI.

You need to install a few new django extensions:
	https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-widget-tweaks
	https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-bootstrap3
	https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-typogrify

The meta goal of this effort is: *** NO CHANGES TO THE PYTHON CODE ***

Whenever changes to the python code are made, they can only fix HTML bugs,
or add comments (tagged with "FACELIFT") about functionality that can be
removed once the facelift templates become default. Or they need to add
functionality that is only called from the new facelift templates.

Javascript that is only used on one template goes into that template.
Javascript that is used by more than one template goes into ietf.js.

CSS that is only used on one template goes into that template.
CSS that is used by more than one template goes into ietf.css. No CSS in the
templates or - god forbid - style tags! (And no CSS or HTML styling in
python code!!)

Templates that use jquery or bootstrap plugins include the css in the pagehead
block, and the js in the js block.
