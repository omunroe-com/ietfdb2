ietfdb (4.37) ietf; urgency=low

  This is a minor bug-fix release of the datatracker.  It fixes issues with
  presentation of IESG discusses and comments, anchor names in the materials
  list page, details of the 1wg-summary.txt page, and some other minor issues.

  * Merged in a patch from housley@vigilsec.com to handle different 
    documents better in the agenda JSON output.

  * Added simple logging of test runs, to make it easier to be sure that 
    tests has been run successfully on the latest code.

  * Added a new field, #16: draft AD (name and email) to all_id2.txt

  * Made the IPR country field wider to accomodate IPR disclosures 
    referencing many patent instances in many countries.

  * Updated draft submission author extraction module to handle dash-separated
    double given names.

  * Tweaks and fixes to the IESG scribe template templates.

  * Added a filter for use in displaying document comments and discusses 
    which unfortunately sometimes use html <br> markup, which should give line 
    breaks, and sometimes contain <email@domain> which should *not* be 
    interpreted as html, but rendered as &lt;...

  * Limited the 1wg-summary list and friends to WGs, (excluding the 'iesg' 
    area which lists the areas as subgroups, for instance).

  * Resolved a naming conflict between the builtin messages framework and a 
    variable named messages in wgcharter.views.change_state.  Fixes issue #901.

  * Tweaked the handling of the syslog module not being available on 
    windows.

  * Fixed what may have been a regression in the form of the anchors in the 
    materials list page.

ietfdb (4.35) ietf; urgency=medium

  This release provides a long list of fixes and minor enhancements, covering
  more than 50 different items found through feedback from users.  Major
  contributors were Robert Sparks, Adam Roach, and Henrik.  The changelog will
  be available at http://datatracker.ietf.org/release/4.35 after deployment.
  The commit log is at http://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/ietfdb/log/trunk

  Details:

  * Added an 'email sent' success message after sending out a WG review 
    announcement.  Todo: Add equivalent messages in all other situations 
    where email is sent out, for consistency.

  * Added various things which lets us use Django's messages framework to 
    give feedback to users.  This includes adding the messages middleware in 
    settings.py, adding a message display are at the top of the page base 
    template, and adding style setting for message display.

  * Tweaked test/mergedevbranch in a number of places in order to simplify 
    handling (merging and testing) of multiple merges.

  * Merged [4909] from rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Reimplemented clear_ballot to close the existing ballot and create a 
    new one. Changed the all_positions code to only return synthetic 
    no-positions for current ADs when a ballot is actually open 

  * Merged [4904] from adam@nostrum.com: 
    Fixing conflict list; adding AD column. 

  * Merged [4885] from rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Refactored close_open_ballots, creating a way to close one abllot at a 
    time. rewrote the clear ballot code to close each open ballot and open a 
    new one 

  * Modified the format of the changelog to confirm fully to the debian 
    changelog format.

  * Added a simple page to show release information parsed from a release's 
    changelog file.

  * Improved the handling of iCalendar timezone information -- instead of 
    simplified VTIMEZONE information generated from a template, the VTIMEZONE 
    information for a meeting's timezone is read from file (where it presumably 
    has been generated from the Olson timezone database, for instance using 
    vzic.

  * Added an utility script to extract information about the outgoing 
    confirmation request email related to a draft submission.

  * Added a management command to generate bibxml files for drafts.  It's 
    not fully cooked yet, as it needs to differentiate between documents which 
    are currently drafts, and those that have been published as RFCs, but the 
    basics are there.

  * Add an name utility function to return a name's initials. Handle names 
    with an uppercase surname to the left of the given name correctly.

  * Added support for reverse-order (i.e., Japanese, Chinese, and other) 
    names with uppercase family name in the draft submission author extraction.

  * Added an 'agenda_note' field to meeting.models.Meeting, and added 
    display of content (if any) in html and txt agendas.

    notification email if there's no ballot.  Also did some linguistic fixes, 
    and got rid of a wildcard import.

  * Make the mergedevbranch script more flexible in accepting different 
    partial repository paths on the command line.

  * Make .ballot_open() available on DocumentInfo instead of on Document, 
    too.

    content 

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  30 Oct 2012 15:19:09 +0100

ietfdb (4.34) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Merged in [4772] from rjsparks@nostrum.com, a big chunk which in itself
    combines a number of separate fixes: 

    Liasion Manager:
    * Patch from Yaco to avoid resetting the From field when changing other 
      items on the form
    * Gave the secretariat the ability to find/approve any unapproved 
      liaisons
    * Changed all the email code to use ietf.mail.utils (and removed the 
      fake-mail concept)

    Charter documents and the Agenda pages:
    * Added charter documents to iesg/agenda and iesg/agenda/documents
    * Synced the ordering of drafts on iesg/agenda and iesg/agenda/documents
    * Allow setting a responsible AD for charter documents
    * Changed the UI of the charter page to use editlink for changing 
      attributes and buttons for actions (to align with drafts and 
      conflict-reviews)

    Moderator package:
    * Refactor: Simplified access to the current BallotDocEvent from a 
      Document
    * Added functions to BallotDocEvents? to faciliate access to 
      BallotPositionDocEvents?, both for all positions, and current AD postions.
    * Updated the moderator package to use the Documents from _agenda_data.
    * Added a filter to assist with rendering the moderator package.
    * Fixed a bug where different functions in idrfc/views_ballot were 
      using log_state_changed expecting different implementations (a cleanup task 
      should reconcile the _three_ implementations in the codebase of that 
      function).

    Cleanup from codesprint:
    * Removed some duplication between doc/util and doc/models by moving 
      things into doc/models
    * Do not show non-empty discuss text when the ballot position is not 
      blocking
    * Added a migration to update non-blocking ballot positions that have 
      non-empty discuss text

    DEPLOYMENT NOTES
    Please be aware that migration step will take a few minutes to complete.
    Fixes issue #865 

  * Tweaked the author extraction code to handle company names in the author
    list on the first page, when the company names contain a comma, such as
    for instance 'Foo Bar, Inc'.

  * Added support for get_file_path() for conflrev documents based on branch 
    /personal/rcross/v4.32@4722, but tweaked to return only the directory, not 
    the full directory+name+ext path, in order to behave the same way as for 
    other document types.

  * Merged in [4746] from adam@nostrum.com: 
    Adding slides to agenda page 

  * Merged in [4738] from adam@nostrum.com: 
    Added a link to the cookie page, at Robert's request 

  * Merged in [4737] from adam@nostrum.com: 
    Fixed profile update page to keep Alias table up to date. Also, roles 
    for inactive groups are no longer displayed on the profile page. 

  * Applied fix from rjsparks@nostrum.com: Remove old document filtering 
    which is now to strict, letting conflict review documents show in the iesg 
    agenda.

  * Applied fix from adam@nostrum.com: Display meeting materials with 
    correct ordering.

  * Removed the ValueError exceptions introduced in the previous revision 
    of the draft author extraction code.  Fixes issue #858.

  * Fixed problem with diff links which erroneously included a template 
    variable interpolation.

  * Fixed problem with displaying ISE stream documents.

  * Fixed the update password request form to *not* give an error for 
    existing accounts ,:-)

  * Fixed some parameter names in the ietfauth urlconf which had reverted to 
    an old form in a recent merge.

  * Used the .plain_name Person attribute in the agenda documents form 
    instead of the full .name attribute.

  * The call to liaison_manager_sdos() in set_organization_field was 
    missing a Person parameter -- added it.

ietfdb (4.33) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is the IETF-84 codesprint release:

  * Changeset [4724] from rbarnes@bbn.com:
    Adjusted the scribe template to make it XHTML compliant and fix what 
    Robert broke 

  * Changeset [4721] from adam@nostrum.com: 
    Adding an 'href' method to documents. It doesn't work for documents 
    of type 'liai-att' or 'liaison', but it's a good start. 

  * Changeset [4709] from housley@vigilsec.com: 
    Ability to fetch the IESG Telechat Agenda as a JSON object 
    (agenda.json). 

  * Changesets [4720], [4706], and [4705] from adam@nostrum.com: 
    Adding self-management page for user profile information 

  * Changeset [4704] from suresh.krishnan@ericsson.com: 
    - When the state changes from whatever to Publication Requested, the 
      regular state change mail will go out.
    - The regular state change mail will be sent to the authors and the wg 
      chairs (this is the current behavior).
    - Now, in addition to this regular state change mail, another mail will 
      be sent with the title 'Publication has been requested for draft 
      <draft-name>' and this mail will be sent to the AD responsible for the WG. 
      I considered sending the mail to both the ADs but decided not to bother the 
      other AD :-).  

  * Changeset [4701] from rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Moved the prefix for the URI to use for rfcdiff into settings.py.
    Fixes bug #808 

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  30 Jul 2012 23:54:19 +0200

ietfdb (4.32) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is a feature release that provides support for a new document type,
  Conflict Review documents (conflrev-*.txt).

  From rjsparks@nostrum.com:

  * Adds a new document type for conflict reviews, with a ballot for the IESG
    5742 response to a review request

  * Integrated the new document type into the iESG agenda views (including RSS
    feeds)

  * Removed the Edit and Add buttons from the document main view.

  * Replaced Add with actions appropriate for the document type, such as
    "Begin IESG Processing" or "Begin IETF Conflict Review", and made most data
    directly editable on the document's main page, depending on access
    permissions.

  * Removed a manual editing step that the secretariat had to perform when
    sending conflict review messages. The view now composes the message
    correctly given the stream.

  * Added a pencil icon motif to differentiate fields that are editable.

  * Generalized several views and helper functions to use Document instead of
    (e.g.) IdWrapper

  * Generalized reading documents from the repository

  * Added a way to get from IdWrapper to the underlying Document to facilitate
    migrating way from the Wrapper classes

  * Added many helpers to Document to assist with migrating off IdWrapper

  * Minor fixes and other changes
    - Fixes to document main view to avoid (silent) template failures. 
    - Began removing some of the code that is no longer reachable post-migration
    - Corrected the behavior of the undefer code and added test cases for it
    - Improved initial population of notification lists and added the ability
      to regenerate the initial list

  * Made the test code that scans for template coverage more robust.

  Deployment notes:
    * new setting: CONFLICT_REVIEW_PATH. The associated directory will need to be created

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  28 Jul 2012 18:29:34 +0200

ietfdb (4.31) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is primarily a bugfix-release, catching a lot of issues related to the
  most recent few releases.  

  A few features have also been included, liste first:

  * Added support for IRTF liaisons.

  * Improved I-D submission author extraction code, adding support for 
    extraction of affiliation, improved date format extraction, support
    for additional (unusual) name abbreviation patterns, and more.

  Bugfixes.  Not all fixes are mentioned here; for a complete list please see
  the commitlog.

  * Fixed a language typo in the registration confirmation page.

  * Tweaked the community tracker notification email.

  * Changed and tweaked various I-D submission emails in order to 1) make it 
    less likely that they would be classified as spam (better ratio of English 
    text to hash urls) and 2) provide better consistency in formatting of 
    key/value information.

  * From adam@nostrum.com: Fixed an URL in the agenda.csv file which hadn't 
    been updated to match current naming conventions and code.

  * Added new RFC-Editor state tag 'AUTH48-DONE' to the rfc-ed-queue mirror 
    script.

  * Tweaked the meeting materials list to avoid duplicate rows for WGs with 
    more than one slot, as long as the materials list is the same (which is the 
    only thing supported by other parts of the system at this time).

  * Applied ballot popup patch from olau@iola.dk.

  * Made links to other versions available also for expired documents.

  * Changed community I-D tracking rule update frequency to every hour.

  * Rewrote the view and template code for the meeting materials list, 
    which was showing nothing.  Better to do the rewrite for the new models 
    than trying to dig into why the proxy models doesn't work any more.

  * Fixed id_abstracts to include drafts assigned directly to areas, not 
    only individual and WG drafts.

  * Fixed 1wg-charters.txt (and friends) to not list the areas as if they were 
    WGs.

  * Updated utils/draft.py and modified the submit app code accordingly.

  * Merged in [4604] from adam@nostrum.com, which fixes problems with the 
    html agenda code related to the schema transition.

  * Ballot ids are limited to integers, rather than being descriptive as 
    intended at one point.  Adjusted the url regexes accordingly.  Patch from 
    olau@iola.dk.

  * Introduced a line break to clean up the state display for tracked drafts 
    a bit.

  * Make the link to the search form more prominent in the community list 
    explicitly added documents page.

  * Sorted WGs in the community rules drop-down list by acronym rather than 
    WG name.

  * Provided a more comprehensive document state indication.  May need 
    further refinement.

  * Tweaked the community tracker links in the lefthand menubar to avoid 
    line breaking for the WG documents link visible to WG chairs.

  * Enabled the check for existing account, disabled when we started using 
    self-service http password reset, but hadn't started creating accounts yet. 

  * Refactored the two confirm*() methods in ietfauth/views.py; they need the 
    same processing, only the templates to use differ.

  * Fixed the back-link on personal list email subscription confirmation page -- 
    it just lead to the confirmation page itself, now leads to read-only list 
    view.

  * When logged in as secretariat, at /iesg/agenda/ or 
    /iesg/agenda/documents/, and clicking on the position matrix for a 
    document, the overlay window would give a code 500 error, because of a 
    missing ballot id in the templates' url lookup.  Fix this by providing the 
    ballot id.

ietfdb (4.30) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is a feature release which provides the community document tracking
  functionality defined in RFC 6293.

  * Merged community tracking branch from esanchez@yaco.es, 
    r3175-3679,3713-3830.

  Some additional fixes and smaller upgrades have also been included, as
  follows:

  From esanchez@yaco.es:

  * Patch to add a new IETF liaison-sending entity "IESG and IAB".

  From olau@iola.dk:

  * Small patch to avoid constant 500 traceback when someone tries to push an
    invalid cookie.

  From henrik@levkowetz.com:

  * Fix a bug which made the community tracking code crash when search 
    results would show an old RFC without an associated draft.

  * Tweak the menubar listing of community tracking to show when login is 
    needed, some other text tweaks, and fitting the I-D tracking links under 
    Drafts and RFCs where they seem to belon.g

  * Minor cleanup of test_runner.py. Added guards against settings which 
    can make tests inexplicably fail.  Updated check to avoid running tests on 
    production server.

  * Remove old non-functional "management issues" link from IESG agenda 
    section 6 title.

  * Add a way to reach charter urls given a wg name rather than the charter 
    document name.

  * Add some help for chairs which fuss about not being able to clearly see 
    that they need to be logged in in order to handle approvals.

  * Behave slightly more gracefully if a submission has already been moved 
    into place, and we are asked to do it again.

  * Disable the reference-to/referenced-by rules of the community app;
    they will only produce hits after we populate the document relationship
    table with reference information.

  * Simplify "document by WG" display name code.

  * Correct typo in community draft tracking subscription confirmation 
    email.

  * Changed the group link on the personal doc list page to use the group 
    acronym instead of whole name, and made the acronym a link to the wg 
    documents page.

  * Tweaked the display of explicitly added documents (saying "explicitly" 
    rather than "manually", and including the active/expired/rfc state of the 
    document.

  * When adding a rule for I-Ds, only apply the selection to active I-Ds,
    not those which are expired or published.

  * Changes to the rule specifications for document tracking lists: 
    Simplify the filter rules, show acronym in wg and area selection lists, 
    list only ADs of active areas.

  * Fixups to the merged code, to match the code refactoring done to trunk
    after the split off of the community development branch.

  * Removed the grep based searches in utils.py; they are too costly.  If 
    tracing lists based on word search is needed, another implementation must 
    be found.

  * Other minor cleanup.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  03 Jul 2012 17:01:08 +0200

ietfdb (4.21) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is a bugfix release for the charter release (4.20) with some
  extra changes which were pending: Updated via-rfc-editor handling,
  better /meeting/requests page, added WG document approval page.

  From olau@iola.dk:  

  * Add approval/pre-approval page for Secretariat and WG Chairs, with
    subpages for adding and canceling pre-approvals and a set of
    migrations for replacing the old IdApprovedDetail with a slightly less
    confusing Preapproval model.

  * Add listing of recently approved drafts to approval page by request
    from Barry Leiba.

  * Replace get_profile() hack with a test on the user instead, this
    also makes the ballot icon more robust against users without profiles
    (which shouldn't happen, but apparently we sometimes get one which
    results in a crash rather than something more graceful)

  * Give the incoming name to the top renderer so the links are internally
    consistent, this is needed because we still have different views for
    /doc/rfcXXXX/ and /doc/draft-foo-bar/

  * Fix regexp fix - [.-_] does not mean "dot or dash or underscore", it
    means all characters between dot and underscore

  * Include _ in allowed document name regexp, we currently have 7 drafts
    with _ in the database despite it not being valid - they can be found
    with:
    select name from doc_document where name like '%\_%' and type_id = "draft";

  * Fix flow of approval of charters/announcement of the WG action based
    on feedback from Cindy Morgan, now there's a link on the approval page
    to go to the edit page which sends you back upon saving, and the edit
    page doesn't provide a button to send the announcement since you
    should do that on the approve page (instead it provides a link).

  * Include current milestones in charter action/review announcements,
    fixes issue #835.

  * Add CC for group mailing list in action/review emails, fixes issue #837.

  * Fix link to charter .txt file on agenda page

  * Apparently, CHARTER_TXT_URL http://www.ietf.org/charters/ is really
    http://www.ietf.org/charter/, fix this in the settings.py file

  * Replace get_profile() hack with a test on the user instead, this
    also makes the ballot icon more robust against users without profiles
    (which shouldn't happen, but apparently we sometimes get one which
    results in a crash rather than something more graceful)

  * Give the incoming name to the top renderer so the links are internally
    consistent, this is needed because we still have different views for
    /doc/rfcXXXX/ and /doc/draft-foo-bar/

  * Fix regexp fix - [.-_] does not mean "dot or dash or underscore", it
    means all characters between dot and underscore

  * Include _ in allowed document name regexp, we currently have 7 drafts
    with _ in the database despite it not being valid - they can be found
    with:
    select name from doc_document where name like '%\_%' and type_id = "draft";

  * Fix flow of approval of charters/announcement of the WG action based
    on feedback from Cindy Morgan, now there's a link on the approval page
    to go to the edit page which sends you back upon saving, and the edit
    page doesn't provide a button to send the announcement since you
    should do that on the approve page (instead it provides a link).

  * Include current milestones in charter action/review announcements,
    fixes issue #835.

  * Add CC for group mailing list in action/review emails, fixes issue #837.

  * Fix link to charter .txt file on agenda page

  From rjsparks@nostrum.com:

  * Expose how many pages each document contains on the docs on future
    telechats page.  Fixes bug #828

  *  Replaced the concept of a tag (via-rfc) identifying ise or irtf document
    (previously the idinternal.via_rfc_editor boolean) with looking at the
    document's stream.  Removed the stream editing form - that functionality
    is on the edit info form.  Put the old-ADs back into the list of choices
    when editing a document's info.  This (re) fixes bug #749

  * Fixed a bug in determining if a document is on the agenda, leftover
    from transition to new schema.

  From adam@nostrum.com:

  * Fix to the requests data page:
     - uses native schema for much greater efficiency
     - Uses meeting ID properly, so it can find future meetings
       even if their ID does not match the meeting number
     - Dramatic improvements to layout

  From henrik@levkowetz.com:

  * Try to not use explicit .html extensions in the urls.  Redirect from 
    those to .html-less urls.

  * Added a new field 'short' to Session, to help produce file names for 
    agendas, minutes and slides for groups with different named session, such 
    as for instance 'edu'.  Generating distinct filenames directly from the 
    name field gives too long names.

  * Quick fix for extensionless get_absolute_url().  XXX Fixme: needs 
    bigger refactoring.

  * Quick fix for crash when going to /wg/imapmove/charter/.  I'm not happy 
    about the 'charter-ietf-' constant which now appears several places in the 
    code; we need settings which defines the correct name pattern for different 
    document types (or a table or table column, maybe).  But this hopefully 
    will make it possible to continue processing proposed WGs ...

  * Added missing '{{' before 'submission.filename' in draft announcement 
    email templates.

  * Other minor fixes

  * Don't try to call get_profile() on a user if the method isn't available.

  * Merged in fixes from Ole, from branch/charter:r4382-4407, and some 
    changes from Henrik (removing the use of pos.blocked in views_ballot.py, 
    and setting a ballot id in idrfc/testsREDESIGN.py) to make 
    idrfc.EditPositionTestCase succeed.

  * Don't include interim meetings in those considered for the default 
    meeting number for the '/meeting/' url.

  * Tweaked the error messages for acronym collisions in the create-wg form.

  * Added quotes around the WG name in the state change text, for better 
    readability.

  * Applied a fix to missing nomcom chair in [4384] instead of [4385].

  * Made arguments to url help_charter_states match the definition in 
    ietf/idrfc/urls.py.

  * Fixed a bug in picking up blocking text (patch provided by olau@iola.dk).

  * Added a parameter to make the commitlog script useful for other branches 
    than the current.

  * Catch exception which is raised if a nomcom NN group has been created, 
    but no nomcom chair has been announced and added yet.

  Merged in [4364] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:

  * Expose how many pages each document contains on the docs on future 
    telechats page. Fixes bug #828 

  Merged in fixes to the charter branch (r4345 - r4353 and r4354 - r4381)
  from olau@iola.dk.:

  * Check and sanitize text file upload (code is factored out in a new
    helper so it can be reused elsewhere in the future).

  * Move charter state help to /doc/help/state/charter/.

  * Say "generate" rather than "edit" when there's no text in the boxes

  * Don't show diff box if there's only 1 entry (and itself).

  * Say "Charter" rather than "Recharter" on the charter /doc/ page if the 
    group is proposed or a BoF.

  * Treat BoF as proposed WG.

  * s/WG/group/ in acronym clash error message.

  * Add a star to the required fields.

  * Fix test broken by previous commit.

  * Fix buggy new group acronym check.

  * Amend previous commit to generate writeups on entering internal review 
    instead.

  * Generate action and review text automatically.

  * Make it move obvious what the change state view actually does by
    rephrasing the form.

  * Fix some phrasing bugs.

  * Fix terminology confusion and say "send ballot" rather than "issue
    ballot" to clear up that it is not actually created.

  * Fix wording of send ballot comment, the actual text was still specific
    to drafts.

  * Don't show edit button for snapshots.

  * Fix bug in hiding "external review needed" checkbox.

  * Create charters in state notrev instead of intrev, as a side effect
    this fixes a problem with comments not being saved when starting
    review on charter.

  * Use revision numbers to identify ballots and put a warning on closed 
    ballots.

  * Fix bug in event description when copying over the final approved
    charter file.

  * Offer text from latest approved revision in case there's no initial text
    for a recharter submit form.

  * Reverse direction of revisions on charter /doc/ page to match 
    tools.ietf.org/html/draft-*.

  * Change max acronym length to 10 instead of 8

  Additional fixes from Henrik:

  * Fixed the signature of DocEventAdmin method (needs explicit 'self' parameter)

  * Added various fixes and correction of merge errors.

  * Merged in fixes to the migration from olau@iola.dk.

  * Merged in the charter branch from olau@iola.dk.

  From Adam:

ietfdb (4.02) ietf; urgency=medium

  Merged [4288] from rjsparks@nostrum.com: 

  * Made several changes to correctly use the new (RFC6410)  "Internet Standard" level
    in email that gets sent at various stages in the handling of documents.  Fixes bug 821.

  Merged branch/iola/migration-fixes@4319, containing these changesets from olau@iola.dk:

  * [4319]: Only query for regular IETF meetings when calculating cut off dates
    (reported by Ryan Cross).

  * [4311]: Fix bug in liaison form that prevents Secretariat users from posting
    statements on behalf of SDO liaison managers in some cases.

  * [4310]: Fix problem with direct replyto path in liaison form not using role
    emails (reported by Stephanie McCammon).

  * [4307]: Fix missing return in liaison proxy, fixes problem with from email
    on https://datatracker.ietf.org/liaison/1154/ as reported by Stephanie
    McCammon.

  * [4260]: Move note about IANA scraping messages, apparently I managed to
    put it in the wrong place (they're of course scraping draft approvals, not
    the ballot announcements).

  * [4253]: Move last call announcement text to last call event rather than
    stuffing it inside the state change event.

  * [4252]: Declare coding system to work around annoying problem when the
    date produced by SVN is localized.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  26 Apr 2012 22:27:36 +0200

ietfdb (4.01) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Made various fixes to test cases in order to support the new code and
    database setup.

  * Merged [4265] from adam@nostrum.com:

    Related to #816 - Modified base.html so that the logo is clickable as 
    well as the text. 

  * Merged [4223] from york@isoc.org: 
    Related to #817 - added a 401.html page for responding to

ietfdb (3.64) ietf; urgency=medium

  This release contains the features and bugfixes from the IETF-82
  code sprint.

  From adam@nostrum.com: 

  * Fixed a bug in is_authorized_in_draft_stream: would never return true 
    for WG chairs.

  From lars.eggert@nokia.com: 

  * Automatically set the recipients of RFC5742 review emails sent by the 
    IESG based on the RFC Stream. 

  * Fixed a typo. 

  From rjsparks@nostrum.com: 

  * Marked area directors who are not on the current IESG with square 
    brackets on the discuss summary page.  Fixes bug 666.

  * Changed the AD status page to group documents by current state.
    Fixes bug 742.

  * Changed the edit info form to allow (force) setting the stream when 
    editing or adding a document to the iesg tracker.  Fixes bug 743.

  From henrik@levkowetz.com:

  * Added a colour indication to the Area/WG overview page showing 
    responsible AD for each WG.  Also some html reformatting for better 
    readability.

  * Be more specific about the submission startup time on meeting Monday.  
    Indicate time and timezone for more cases on the submission form.

  * Various fixes to test fixtures and admin pages.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  16 Nov 2011 07:08:11 +0100

ietfdb (3.63) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is a feature release which adds support for Alternate Stream draft
  tracking, similar to the WG Chair draft tracking.  Some bug fixes have
  also been included.

  From esanchez@yaco.es:

  * Merged /branch/yaco/wgchairs.r3120:r3154-3558 from esanchez@yaco.es.  
    This adds support for alternate streams document tracking, similar to the 
    WG chairs tracking functionality.

  * Merged /branch/yaco/wgchairs.r3120/static/media:r3152-3153.  Do not 
    show the draft addoption form when editing stream. See #671.

  * Merged /branch/yaco/wgchairs.r3120/static/media:r3122-3152.  Do no try 
    to create an already existing model. See #671.

  From henrik@levkowetz.com:  

  * Improved handling of a particular IO Error that sometimes occur during 
    draft submission.

  * Removed some of the bling and unnecessary information from the document 
    WG state display.

  * Aligned the workflow admin display lists with the current model fields.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  03 Nov 2011 13:50:14 +0100

ietfdb (3.62) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is a minor bugfix release in preparation for merging in the Alternate
  Streams draft tracker enhancements.

  * Fixed a problem where server IO failures could be silently discarded
    resulting in an ID submission upload being quietly ignored, returning
    the upload form anew.

  * Changed to a more helpful text on the 500 server error page.

  * Tweaked various submission cutoff message strings.  Also made the cut-off
    messages use the actual hour defined in settings, rather than a hardcoded
    string saying '5 PM (PT)' ...

  * Cleaned up the display of 'Sign In' and version number when rendering the 
    base template without context (which is the case for the 500 server error 
    template).

  * Fixed a wrong settings variable (introduced when merging code from the 
    yaco idsubmit branch for v3.61).  Refine the error report for failures to 
    move files from staging to repository.

  * Refined the admin list page for submission details a bit.

  * Change the 'Sign In' link to be https, preventing clear-text passwords
    over the wire (given the current use of basic http auth, rather than
    diget auth, on the web server).

  * Added a 'Report a bug' link in the lefthand column, below the version
    indication.

  * The cutoff hour setting is in UTC, not PST or PDT.  Adjusted 
    accordingly in the settings file.

ietfdb (3.61) ietf; urgency=medium

  From esanchez@yaco.es: 

  * Check for missed files on staging area. Fixes #707 

  * Validate title extraction. Fixes #706 

  From henrik@levkowetz.com:

  * Improved extraction of draft title during submission.

  * Fixed a problem where the scan for an author's email address was
    prematurely terminated because another author's affiliation also was part
    of this author's address information.

  * Changed the length of the username field from 30 to 64 characters,
    to avoid datatracker login problems for people with long email
    addresses.

  * Speeded up things and increased reliability during submission author
    information extraction by looking for a recognizable author's address
    section, and not searching for author names earlier in the document if
    found.  Fixes a known bad case where the author name occurred in the
    middle of a draft.

  * Added handling for the case where an author name is followed by 
    parentheses which are not closed on the same line.

  * Added some columns to the admin interface for WgProceedingsActivities.
    Fixed breakage in the feeds code caused by table entries for this model
    containing meeting FKs which don't have an associated meeting entry.  The
    base problem of broken table entries remain, though.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  19 Oct 2011 15:46:27 +0200

ietfdb (3.60) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Added basic automated apache password management functionality.

  * Merged [3331] from rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Make it more likely that one will issue a ballot when it makes sense 
    to do so.  Fixes bug 703. 
  * From smccammon@amsl.com:
    Updated field help for liaison statements, to match the current form.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  19 Aug 2011 00:11:00 +0200

ietfdb (3.58) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Merged [3272] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Fixed errors with the edit state link, the new ability to set an initial
    state when adding a document, the status date on the edit state form, and
    brought several tests up to date.  Fixes issues 695, 696, 697, and 698.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  12 Aug 2011 22:42:14 +0200

ietfdb (3.57) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Merged [3254] from suresh.krishnan@ericsson.com: 
    Added a link to the ARO search including the IESG lists 

  * Merged [3249] from suresh.krishnan@ericsson.com: 
    Allowing adding documents in AD is watching state in addition to the 
    default Publication Requested state. Fixes issue #684 

  * Merged [3245] from rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Removes the "Change State" button and makes changing state a link 
    further up on the form.  This fixes bug 683, but creates a new one that
    we will need to address later - editing the state of an RFC that is going
    through the iesg process again (for going to draft in place for example)
    will need followup once the changes to get an rfc into that state easily
    are made.

  * Merged [3246] from adam@nostrum.com: 
    Adding page to allow viewing meeting slot requests as they are made. 
    There's no link to these yet. 

  * Merged [3240] from adam@nostrum.com: 
    Added csv output format for meeting agenda information, to assist
    external applications (e.g., Android app, iPhone app) in harvesting
    and displaying meeting agenda info. 

  * Merged [3182] from adam@nostrum.com: 
    Fix for bug 677 -- no longer assume that code sprint will always be 
    scheduled. 

  * Merged [3181] from adam@nostrum.com: 
    Fix for bug 676 

  * Merged [3166] from rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Simple changes to EditInfoForm field initialization 

  * Various bugfixes and admin enhancements from henrik@levkowetz.com:
    - Some enhancements to the admin for IDInternal
    - Fix a bug where the wrong text was shown for IPR declarations which 
      specified that licensing terms would be announced later (option d).
    - Fix a bug where the plenary entries in the html agenda didn't have 
      links to the room map.
    - Enhance the admin list page for Stream a bit.
    - Add some debug output utility functions.
    - Tweak the admin list for WgMeetingSession to show wg acronym instead of 
      group id.

ietfdb (3.56) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is a minor release with various bugfixes and minor admin enhancements.
  The most long-term noticable enhancement is added support for app- and
  module-specific admin email addresses which will receive stack traces on
  uncaught exceptions.

  Details:

  * Change the cutoff-settings to match what's desired.  Move CUTOFF_HOUR 
    to settings.  Change the submission page template to not show the form 
    during the down period.

  * Set up app-specific email addresses so the respective developers will 
    be notified about failures in code they have worked with.  Make django
    pick up app- and module-specific admin email addresses for stack trace
    messages.

  * Make admin form lists work a bit better with non-ascii content in 
    non-unicode tables.

  * Admin support for StreamedID, so one can look at it.

  * Get person info without limiting hits to iesglogins.  WG Chairs will have 
    logins but not IESG logins ...

  * Tweak ipr search to only look for IPRs in the appropriate state.

  * Tweak PersonOrOrgName.email() to handle non-ascii names a bit better.

  * Don't let the linewrapping algorithm churn infinitely.

  * Some IPR admin tweaks.  Provide a __unicode__ method and show a contact 
    even if multiple have been set for an IPR declaration.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  23 Jul 2011 15:27:36 +0200

ietfdb (3.55) ietf; urgency=medium

  This release adds the wgchair tracker functionality, and also contains
  some bugfixes.

  Feature:

  * Merged in branch branch/yaco/wgchairs from esanchez@yaco.es.  This 
    provides the WG Chair Tracker functionality.

  Fixes:

  * Changed the default initial state for a WG document to 'WG Document', 
    instead of 'Call for Adoption ...'.

  * Labelled the link to edit a document's WG state 'Change WG State', in 
    order to not confuse it with changing the IESG state.

  * Reordered the state information for a document into related groups, 
    separated by rulers.  Add some indentation to the template code to make it 
    a bit easier to read in some places.

  * Made the WG a draft belongs to into a link to the WG page.

  * Corrected an inappropriate use of the idsubmission repository location 
    instead of the ID repository.  Reported by Robert Sparks.

  * Correct the text (add an omitted word 'press').  Reported by Tomas Narten.

  * Fixed a problem with author extraction when a given name is the same as 
    the surname.

  * Only try to return a shepherd for a document if one has been assigned 
    to the document.

  * Merged in changes from esanchez@yaco.es, changeset [3067].  Makes 
    Liaisons' Date field editable.

  * Added a bit of admin goodness for MeetingSessions.

ietfdb (3.54) ietf; urgency=medium

  From rjsparks@nostrum.com:

  * Restructured the position editing page to better integrate the defer button.
    Fixes bug #659

  * Copied the jquery-1.5.1.min.js library into /static/js/lib (from
    /static/js) because that's where the main document template was looking for
    it. There have probably been several problems since the change that left
    this dangling that showed up as things not behaving, but not as errors. The
    one that clued me in was the discuss text-box not being hidden when the
    position wasn't DISCUSS.  They should all behave better now.

  * Added a django form validator to the discuss text field to not allow
    actions when the position is Discuss, but the discuss-text is empty.  2 and
    3 together fix bug #660

  * Added logic to the undefer fuction to put the document back on the
    previous telechat (if that hasn't already passed). That is, date1 from
    telechat dates, and not date2.  Fixes bug #661

  * Changed the last_call_announcement generation function's template to
    include the abstracts from the document sets (which with modern usage means
    the abstract of the document) reflecting the IESGs decision of a few months
    back.  Fixes bug #662

  * Removed the old tracker link from the document's main page. Fixes bug #663 

  From henrik@levkowetz.com:

  * Handle email recipient lists which contain 'None' elements correctly.
    Fixes an instance of failure to send notifications about a submitted
    draft where an author email address was missing.

  * Add an admin interface to the I-D submission app, to make it easier to
    handle manual tasks related to submissions.

  * Add the submission hash to initial-revision-approval emails to WG chairs,
    so their approvals will take effect.  Fixes a problem where WG Chair
    approvals of WG draft submissions didn't take effect

  * Apply 'autoescape off' to all email templates which don'have it but 
    might need it, to avoid html entity escapes in emails.  Fixes another
    set of instances where this potentially could occur.

  * We cannot currently assume that BallotInfo entries matching 
    IDInternal.ballot exists. It seems ballot may be set to a value before the 
    actual ballot entry is created, possibly by some old secretariat tool. Very 
    broken, but we need to survive it :-(  Fixes a crash in the admin
    interface.

  * Reordered entries of submission forms and notification emails to be
    more appropriate.

  * Changed wrapping of formatted text to expand tabs during text wrapping, in
    order to get consistent indentation handling.

ietfdb (3.53) ietf; urgency=medium

  From esanches@yaco.es:

  * Do not allow cancellation of submissions with GET requests, and Ensure
    that 'get full url', 'approve' and 'force' views are called via POST
    request. Insert a button to perform the last step of autopost via POST
    request. Fixes #650  

  * Do not assume that the two_pages_field field is not None. Fixes #651

  * Allow creation dates that are 3 days after or 3 days before the current
    date. Fixes #652

  * Change substate from Revised ID Needed to AD Followup if needed. Fixes #654

  * Fix expected revision for expired drafts. Fixes #656

  * Send announcements when posting new version of a draft. Fixes #649

  From henrik@levkowetz.com:

  * Previous IPR information in last call announcements could be 
    incomplete.  Use a better search for IPR declarations related to a 
    document, and include the IPR information in the last call preview.
    Fixes an AD request and a request from the IESG

  * When extracting meta-information from drafts, it is required that some 
    data reside on the first page.  Split unpaginated drafts into chunks so we 
    can adhere better to this.  Fixes a bug where submission filename was
    picked up (incorrectly) later in a document.

  * Wrap long lines in the 'save and send email' view of AD ballot comments 
    and discusses.  Fixes a request from the IESG

  * Give development and test deployment a /robots.txt which doesn't permit 
    robots.  Avoids indexing of development servers by web spiders.

  * For this release, the idsubmit port from esanchez@yaco.es has been merged
    in, which constitute substantial added functionality.  This integrates the
    draft upload functionality with the python/django datatracker; it improves
    draft submission handling and security, and fixes problems with database
    breakage and inconsistency caused by the old implementation.  With this also
    comes a major improvement of author extraction from draft text, provided by
    the ietf/utils/draft.py module from henrik@levkowetz.com.

  * Deployment note:  Once the new release has been placed in its deployment
    directory, and the correct settings_local.py has been copied in, a command
    needs to be run in order to update the database tables to work with the new
    code.  In the directory containing the ietf/ directory, run this command:

        $ PYTHONPATH=$PWD ietf/manage.py migrate

    The output should be as follows:

	Running migrations for liaisons:
	- Nothing to migrate.
	Running migrations for submit:
	 - Migrating forwards to 0003_add_extra_name_fields.
	 > submit: 0001_initial
	 > submit: 0002_add_submission_hash
	 > submit: 0003_add_extra_name_fields
	 - Loading initial data for submit.

    Once this is done, the regular deployment routine should be continued.

  This is a minor bugfix release.

  * Merged in [3029] from esanchez@yaco.es.  Make the Cc: field of new 
    liaisons editable.

  * Set the 'person' field of the LegacyLiaisonUser in the admin interface 
    to be handled as a raw id field with search button, rather than as a choice 
    list.  This should make admin updates involving the LegacyLiaisonUser table
    much speedier.

  * Added a new fix for empty query strings to /meeting/agenda/agenda.ics.  
    (The QUERY_STRING in request.META is not set the same way under the builtin
    server as under Apache; under apache there will be a QUERY_STRING entry wich
    is explicitly Null.  Handles this.)

  * Included a javascript change not previsously merged in from branch/yaco/liaison/.

  This is a minor bugfix release.

  * Fix the weekday-dependent plenary information in the materials list.

  * In urls under /wg/, only accept wgnames which adhere to the constraints
    currently practiced.  (Before this change, the URL patterns would match wg
    names containing non-ascii characters, which later would bomb due to mix of
    collations when accessing the database. Might as well return a 404 at once
    instead).

  * Don't return 500 if the /meeting/agenda/agenda.ics URL is without query part.

  * Get rid of a print statement used during testing.

  * From adam@nostrum.com: 
    Meeting boxes now expand to reveal all text when users hover over them.
    Fixes ticket #602. 

  * From kivinen@iki.fi: 
    Added an URL to retrieve a text/plain version of the list of drafts for
    a given WG.  Useful for building WG-speific ePub documents of a WG's
    drafts.

  * From shane@time-travellers.org:
    Updated the JavaScript associated with the search page to 
    control whether the 'search' button is enabled or not. It is
    now enabled if either the main search box has input, or if
    any of the sub-options have input, or both.

    Adds a view of documents currently in IETF Last Call.  Fixes #630.

    Remove explicit URLs in the code, using reverse() and the newly created
    helper function reverse_lazy().  Fixes #628.

  * From rjsparks@nostrum.com:

  * Provide a full URL to IPR issues in the last call email, rather than just
    the local url path.  Fixes an issue reported by Russ.

  * Tweak the admin interface for WGs and Chairs, adding some useful links 
    to the tabular displays.

  * Add refinements for the liaison admin interface.  Show contact link and 
    coloured Login/User links to show broken entries.

  * Wrap the sdo name query in a try clause to avoid server 500 errors.

  * Only try to populate the liaison user/email list from the from_entity 
    if it's set.

  * Make the document announcement default Cc: somewhat configurable.  
    Remove iab@iab.org (on request).

  * Link to the State help page from the 'State:' label.

  * Don't use '&lt;' and '&gt;' in text/plain email text.

  * Don't permit just any characters in the document name; limit this to 
    characters we currently permit in the names, or which has occurred in 
    posted documents.  Fixes a problem where non-ascii characters were 
    propagated to the database search and caused collation sequence exceptions, 
    instead of giving 404 errors.

  * Remove the To/From/Subject headers from extra headers to prevent 
    duplicate headers.

ietfdb (3.12) ietf; urgency=medium

  Note: Deploying this release requires a database schema update, see below.

  From esanches@yaco.es:

  * Allow an SDO Liason Manager to send outgoing liaison from any IETF
    Entity to his SDO.

  * Allow the secretariat to send liaisons on behalf of another user.

  * On login, retrieve the person record related to the login from the 
    legacy tables of non IESG logins. Provides the link between login name
    and person listed in the liaison manager table.  Fixes #576.

  * Refined handling of the To: and From: address lists when the Liaison
    Manager is also a WG Chair or AD.

  From henrik@levkowetz.com:

  * Add a clean_whitespace filter in some places to get rid of any newlines 
    embedded in document titles.  Fixes a problem with bad email headers
    in announcements related to documents with newlines embedded in the title.

  * Don't try to send out mail which has no recipients.  Fixes a crash when
    trying to send announcements related to drafts which have an empty
    'email notes to' field.

  * Fix typo in method calls to send email, fixes a crash when submitting
    liaison statements.

  * Renamed 'LiaisonDetail.taken_care' field to 'action_taken'.  
    Miscellaneous associated fixes.  Enhanced liaison-related admin pages.

  Note: Deploying this release requires an additional steps to create
    a new column in a table.  This is done as a South migration
    (see http://south.aeracode.org/ for more info on South):

    # 8<----------
    # First the regular checkout and prepare:

    # Next, apply the migrations:
 
       PYTHONPATH=$PWD ietf/manage.py migrate liaisons

    # Then carry on with the usual actions:

  * Fixed a bug in the IPR Search, where searches against the IPR notice
    content would fail (Only try to open a legacy url if it leads to a
    file; not if it leads to a directory).

  * For a new IESG tracker document, only add a history comment about
    previous history if some previous history exists (i.e., if the replaced 
    document also existed in the IESG tracker).

  * Show status of Dead Expired documents appropriately; just 'Expired' is 
    insufficient.

  * Restore, for the secretariat only, the re-scheduling functionality of 
    the /iesg/agenda/documents/ page which was removed in [2366] as the ADs 
    felt that it made the page too busy.

  * Propagate all extra fields on to the final email sending function, not 
    only the Cc and Bcc fields.  Restores previously missing Reply-To: headers.

  * Turn autoescaping off for everything in text/plain email templates.  Fixes
    multiple problems with '<' and '>' in emails showing up as '&lt;' and
    '&gt;', and related problems.

  * The liaison tool is deployed.  Show the links to the new tool.

  * Prevent things from crashing if some of the email fields are null for a 
    liaison.

  * It should be possible to edit the area of a draft even if it's been set 
    before.  Re-enabled the area list box on the document/edit/info/ page.

  * Corrected spelling error in list_display specification for the 
    PersonOrOrgInfo Admin page.

  * Corrected the path to the draft archive in the settings file.

    (Some of the fixes above has been deployed already before this release
    by patching the previous release on the server.)

  * Tweak some GUI strings in the Liaison Manager

  * Added week-at-a-time view to agenda page when viewing selected areas 
    and/or groups. If no groups are selected, the week view is hidden, leaving the
    base-level functionality unchanged.

    configurable.

  From lars.eggert@nokia.com: 

  * Fix for #467: History tab: Avoid HTTP/HTTPS warning for the diff tool form
    submission.

  * Fix for #456: Make it possible for an IESG member to add a comment (for
    the document history) in the 'change document state' dialog

  * Fix for #537: Remove redundant "by" info from doc history text.

  * Fix for #525. Adds more information to the document history tab,
    specifically changes to writeup, announcement and last-call text.

  * Fix for #372. Makes the position editing form display the name of the
    document being edited.

  * Fix for #526 and #530: Change the format of the notification email sent
    out when an AD posts a ballot position on a draft, it by default CCs that
    email to the authors and chairs, and adds some explanatory text to the body
    of those messages. 

  From rjsparks@nostrum.com: 

  * Changed the language used in the last call email to be closer to the
    language the tracker uses when no IPR declarations are found directly on the
    draft. Fixes #506

  * Retained search results on login. Fixes #482.

  * Added filename to the subject of Protocol Action and Document Action email
    messages (and fixed a bug that was preventing CC/BCC from being honored).
    Fixes issue #528.

  From fenner@fenron.net: 

  * Split the /doc/ tabs into separate pages. This fixes #533. (Eventually,
    this will use <link rel=prefetch> to ask the tabs to be prefetched when the
    first tab is loaded, as documented at
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Link_prefetching_FAQ, but as there is some
    issues with this which haven't been fully resolved, the prefetch part is not
    part of this release.)

  * Fill in the X-IETF-IDTracker header with the I-D Tracker version number.
    This fixes #513

  * Added support for admin site documentation 

  From henrik@levkowetz.com:

  * Updated IESG Agenda Section 3.3 title

  * Added fix for announcement email multipart bug, in part contributed
    by glen@amsl.com and tony@att.com.

    scheduled announcements.

    The command-line front-ends are in bin/ as expire-ids, expire-last-calls
    and send-scheduled-mail. The last one already existed with some code, but
    it's not certain it actually worked. The new one accepts the same arguments
    as the Perl script (there's a little bit of help if you run it).

    All three log to syslog.  They need to be started from cron with
    PYTHONPATH=/a/www/ietf-datatracker/web , in the same manner as other
    scripts which use the django models to interact with the database.

  From esanchez@yaco.es:

  * Merged in Yaco's Liaison Management Tool Port & Rewrite.  Enjoy!

  Note: Deploying this release requires additional steps; to verify
  that liaison related settings in settings.py are correct, and to create
  new tables and update existing tables and table content.  The latter
  is done as South migrations (see http://south.aeracode.org/ for more
  info on the South app).  More extensiive documentation about the actions
  needed are provided in the user manual (doc/LSMT_user_manual.pdf in
  the release).  The brief version follows:

    # 8<----------
    # First the regular checkout and prepare:

       cd /a/www/ietf-datatracker
       svn co http://svn.tools.ietf.org/svn/tools/ietfdb/tags/3.07
       cp web/ietf/settings_local.py 3.07/ietf/
       cd 3.07

    # Verify that the new variables in settings.py are correct; if not,
    # add the correct settings in settings_local.py and inform the release
    # manager of the correct settings so they can be incorporated in the
    # next release.  The variables in question are (as set in the release):
    #
    # # The email address from wich all liaison emails come:
    # LIAISON_UNIVERSAL_FROM = 'Liaison Statement Management Tool <lsmt@' + IETF_DOMAIN + '>'
    #
    # # The filesystem path where the liaison attachments will be saved:
    # LIAISON_ATTACH_PATH = '/a/www/ietf-datatracker/documents/LIAISON/'
    #
    # # The url from where the webserver serves the liaison attachments
    # LIAISON_ATTACH_URL = '/documents/LIAISON/'

    # Next, the changes to the MySQL tables will be done.
    # You can list the table migrations which will be applied if desired,
    # this should list migrations from 0001_... to 0009_... under liaisons:

       PYTHONPATH=$PWD ietf/manage.py migrate --list

    # Apply the migrations:
 
       PYTHONPATH=$PWD ietf/manage.py migrate

    # Add the static/doc location as statically served files to the apache
    # configuration.  Fix line 6 in etc/apache2/vhoosts.d/ietf-datatracker.common
    # to read:
    #  <LocationMatch "^/(?!(cgi-bin|css|documents|error|idst|images|js|media|doc|private)/|robots.txt).*$">
    # (i.e., add '|doc' to the exception list).

    # Then carry on with the usual actions:

       cd ../
       rm ./web; ln -s 3.07 web
       sudo /etc/init.d/apache restart

    # 8<----------

  Once the datatracker is up and running with the new liaison tool in
  place, liaison role assignments have to be done as described in
  the LSMT user manual (in doc/LSMT_user_manual.pdf) page 14, summarized
  by Patrik on the yaco-liaison-tool mailing list:

    1. Add the IAB and IETF chairs, wg chairs, area directors etc as
    apropriate (as described in the document).

    2. Add the liaisons in the IETF assigned and named on the IAB list of
    liaisons.

  * From olau@iola.dk: Fix for issue #351 which caused server error when
    editing the state of a document (as IESG user).

  The following features were included already in v3.03, but by mistake
  weren't listed in the changelog for that revision:

  * IETF 78 Sprint code from Peter Musgrave: Add related documents section to
    the wg documents page (e.g., /wg/sipclf/).

  * IETF 78 Sprint code from Robert Sparks: Relabel the 'Issue Ballot' button
    (for AD use, on the draft info page).

  * IETF 78 Sprint code from Robert Sparks: provide a downloadable tarball of
    the documents on the IESG agenda of a given date.

    processing but don't have a ballot yet.

  * Always make idinternal.docstate() return a string -- there are callers 
    that assume this, like the script which generates all_id2.

  * Don't fail with a server error (500) if a bad draft name (containing 
    for instance newlines) is entered -- just return a 404.

  * For WG charters under evaluation, show the year too, not only month and 
    day.  This will reveal bad date information in the charter files.

  * If we fail to parse the date of a WG charter under evaluation, use 1 
    Jan 1900, and carry on.  Don't fail with a server error.

  * This release adds the IOLA port of the former Perl IESG datatracker to
    the Python/Django datatracker.  This should make most AD actions on
    drafts available through the Django datatracker, normally from the
    datatracker.ietf.org/doc/<draftname>/ page or from the /doc/ad/.../
    page, or expressed UI-wise: from the pages reached from the 'AD Dashboard'
    menu at the top of the lefthand menubar in the datatracker.  This
    includes actions such as:

    - Change draft state
    - Edit draft metadata
    - Defer ballot, undefer ballot
    - Handle ballot comments
    - Handle ballot writeups
    - Approve ballots
    - Initiate last call

    Secretariat staff actions supported through the Django datatracker now
    includes:

    - Manage telechat dates
    - Manage working group descriptions

    Tweaks to the new interface and capabilities will be releases with
    a short release cycle, as they are discovered and fixed over the next
    weeks.

    ballots: /doc/<draftname>/ballot.tsv and /doc/<draftname>/ballot.json .
    Json data for the whole document is available for all drafts at
    /doc/<draftname>/doc.json .

  * Added Unicode NFKC normalization of paths.  Somebody just tried to access 
    /wg/ipfix/charter/ with 'fi' represented as the unicode ligature \ufb01...

  * Changed the text emitted during testing to have less noise at the
    beginning of the line -- only 'OK', 'Fail', and the initial line of coverage
    reports now starts at the beginning of the line, without whitespace.  This
    makes it easier to scan a test run visually to find reported failures.

  * Add an html sanitizer and a sanitize_html template filter.  This uses
    the html5lib, which has also been included in the svn tree.

  * Provide better handling of both text/plain document comments and 
    document comments which contain html tags.  Adds urlization, 
    linebreak-preservation and html sanitization.  Html sanitization would be 
    better applied when adding comments, but we're not yet a position to 
    enforce this for all input paths.

  * Catch an additional exception which can occur during generation of 
    all_id2.txt

  * Parse stream/wg/file formats from rfc-index.xml; prepare for parsing 
    auth48 info from queue2.xml

  * IPR disclosures: Don't include .doc/.html inline; don't fail if file 
    does not exist

  * Replaced /drafts/* with redirects

  * Show datatracker version+date in new look, too

  * IESG discuss page: shade even/odd rows

  * Use new look for IETF meeting agenda; add color-coding support (like

ietfdb (2.44) ietf; urgency=medium

  From Robert:

  * Moved old (1995-2003) liaison statements from the template file
    to the database. This requires applying database fixups as
    follows:

        cd /a/www/ietf-datatracker/2.44/ietf
        PYTHONPATH=../ python manage.py dbshell < ../test/liaison_fixup.sql

    And updating the liaison files as follows:

	cd /a/www/ietf-datatracker/documents/LIAISON/
        # TAKE A BACKUP OF THE WHOLE DIRECTORY, JUST IN CASE
	. /a/www/ietf-datatracker/2.44/test/liaison_fixup.sh

  From Pasi:

  * Use new look for more pages

  * Make obsoletes/updates/etc. lists links (with new urlize_ietf_docs 
    template filter)

  * Always show year in /idtracker/status/ dates

  * /doc/rfcNNNN/: show the internet-draft name (if known) and link to its 
    history; show information about post-RFC IESG processing

  * Use yellow for 'abstain' also in /iesg/agenda/documents/

  * IESG ballot grid icon: show 'abstain' as yellow instead of gray

  * IESG telechat agenda: include "private" links also if logged in, link 
    from document list

  * Added IPR/dependency links and edit/add buttons for RFCs, too; some 
    template refactoring

  * Avoid exceptions from MySQL when searching for non-ASCII draft names/WG 
    acronyms/etc.

  * Handle non-ASCII characters gracefully in old cgi-bin script redirects

  * IPR search: handle non-numeric RFC numbers/ID document tags gracefully 
    (instead of uncaught exception)

  * Change Atom feeds (+couple of other places) to point to /doc/draft-.. 
    instead of /idtracker/draft-.../

  From Henrik:

  * In PersonOrOrgInfo.email(), try harder to find a relevant email address.
    The new code will eventually fall back to a broad filter which matches that
    of the perl code which creates WG charter pages, where the old code would
    sometimes result in django-generated charter pages with missing email
    addresses.

  * Serve ipr disclosures which are available on the server directly, 
    instead of through an external http link in an <iframe/>.  The <iframe/> 
    method can result in mixing https and http content in the page, which some 
    browser take issue with.

  * Add back in rudimentary Django Admin support which was lost in the 0.96 
    -> 1.1 transition.

  * The 'current agenda' url can fail between meetings, when the 'current 
    meeting number' has been bumped up, but not all relevant information has 
    been entered yet.  Fall back to the most recent meeting for which an agenda 
    can be produced in that case.

  * The self.affiliation() call can sometimes cause an exception, too, due 
    to the deficiencies of the database.  Use something safer as fallback.

  From Pasi:

  * Show various edit buttons only to ADs/secretariat

  * Simplify WG menu a bit

  * Fix comment handling for drafts not in idinternal; use select_related

ietfdb (2.39) ietf; urgency=medium

  From Pasi:

        AuthName "IETF Datatracker"
        AuthUserFile /a/www/htpasswd
	Require valid-user

  * With this release, the datatracker is changed to run under Django 1.1
    rather than under 0.96, and in this sense it is a major release.  There
    is however very few changes that can be seen by the users, which is the
    reason why there is no major bump in the release number.

  Major changes, from Pasi and the code sprint participants:

  * Imported django/ directory from Django-1.1.1.tar.gz, placed in parallel
    with the top-level ietf/ directory in the tree.  This lets us run with
    a version of Django which could possibly be different than the system
    installed version.

  * Automated conversion of the code base to django-1.1 conventions, e.g.
    to use max_length instead of maxlength in model declarations.

  * Lots of escape and safe filters added to the templates, to handle the
    transition from 0.96 to 1.1.  This work was contributed by a number of
    people durint the IETF 76 code sprint:
	Pasi Eronen (also leading up to the IETF 76 code sprint)
	Tony Hansen
	Ben Campbell
	Tero Kivinen
	Adam Roach
	Arifumi Matsumoto

  * Code cleanup, including removal of unused and seldomly used code (in
    particular the code for mailing list change requests)

  * A lot more test cases added, in preparation for the transition to 1.1;
    also refinement of the testing framework.

  From Lars Eggert:

  * Support the use of UTF-8 in emails

  * Fixed the IPR submission tool to work under Django 1.1

    because the foreign key isn't really a foreign key

  * Fix author name (Unicode) and pubdate (datetime vs. date) for Django 1.x

  * Use IDInternal.comments method to avoid foreign key problems; support 
    Unicode in jsonify_helper

    order in which the database backend returns records.

  * Various fixes to the new charter page generation.  Removed the area
    prefix for secretaries (secretaries aren't area secretaries, they're
    secretaries to the group).  Added tech advisors and WG editors.
    Fixed html for secretary lists.

  * Fixed link in Slides model (should be moved to templates, I suspect)
    which has changed since ietf-74.  Todo: Should be made consistent in
