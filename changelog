ietfdb (3.50)

  * For this release, the idsubmit port from esanchez@yaco.es has been merged
    in, which constitute substantial added functionality.  This integrates the
    draft upload functionality with the python/django datatracker; it improves
    draft submission handling and security, and fixes problems with database
    breakage and inconsistency caused by the old implementation.  With this also
    comes a major improvement of author extraction from draft text, provided by
    the ietf/utils/draft.py module from henrik@levkowetz.com.

  * Deployment note:  Once the new release has been placed in its deployment
    directory, and the correct settings_local.py has been copied in, a command
    needs to be run in order to update the database tables to work with the new
    code.  In the directory containing the ietf/ directory, run this command:

        $ PYTHONPATH=$PWD ietf/manage.py migrate

    The output should be as follows:

	Running migrations for liaisons:
	- Nothing to migrate.
	Running migrations for submit:
	 - Migrating forwards to 0003_add_extra_name_fields.
	 > submit: 0001_initial
	 > submit: 0002_add_submission_hash
	 > submit: 0003_add_extra_name_fields
	 - Loading initial data for submit.

    Once this is done, the regular deployment routine should be continued.

ietfdb (3.16)

  This is a minor bugfix release.

  * Merged in [3029] from esanchez@yaco.es.  Make the Cc: field of new 
    liaisons editable.

  * Set the 'person' field of the LegacyLiaisonUser in the admin interface 
    to be handled as a raw id field with search button, rather than as a choice 
    list.  This should make admin updates involving the LegacyLiaisonUser table
    much speedier.

  * Added a new fix for empty query strings to /meeting/agenda/agenda.ics.  
    (The QUERY_STRING in request.META is not set the same way under the builtin
    server as under Apache; under apache there will be a QUERY_STRING entry wich
    is explicitly Null.  Handles this.)

  * Included a javascript change not previsously merged in from branch/yaco/liaison/.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  07 Apr 2011 17:15:41 +0200

ietfdb (3.15)

  This is a minor bugfix release.

  * Fix the weekday-dependent plenary information in the materials list.

  * In urls under /wg/, only accept wgnames which adhere to the constraints
    currently practiced.  (Before this change, the URL patterns would match wg
    names containing non-ascii characters, which later would bomb due to mix of
    collations when accessing the database. Might as well return a 404 at once
    instead).

  * Don't return 500 if the /meeting/agenda/agenda.ics URL is without query part.

  * Get rid of a print statement used during testing.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  06 Apr 2011 15:17:11 +0200

ietfdb (3.14)

  * From lars.eggert@nokia.com: 
    Update jQuery to 1.5.1 and jQuery UI to 1.8.11.

  * From adam@nostrum.com: 
    On the agenda page, for the custom agenda display, now only displays groups
    that are actually meeting.

    Remove unused images. Convert GIFs to smaller PNGs.
    Optimize all images with http://www.smushit.com/ysmush.it/ 

  * From lars.eggert@nokia.com: 
    Change default vertical alignment of various datatracker tables
    for better readability.

  * From peter.musgrave@magorcorp.com: 
    Fix typo. Fixes #566.

  * From jelte@nlnetlabs.nl: 
    Make search result table headers clickable; clicking will sort on said 
    column, fixes #484.

  * From peter.musgrave@magorcorp.com: 
    Don't show AD/Secretariat links for Last Call etc. if they will 404.
    Fixes #550.

  * From adam@nostrum.com: 
    Meeting boxes now expand to reveal all text when users hover over them.
    Fixes ticket #602. 

  * From kivinen@iki.fi: 
    Added an URL to retrieve a text/plain version of the list of drafts for
    a given WG.  Useful for building WG-speific ePub documents of a WG's
    drafts.

  * From shane@time-travellers.org:
    Updated the JavaScript associated with the search page to 
    control whether the 'search' button is enabled or not. It is
    now enabled if either the main search box has input, or if
    any of the sub-options have input, or both.

  * From rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Adds a view of documents currently in IETF Last Call.  Fixes #630.

  * From bmheight@gmail.com:
    Remove explicit URLs in the code, using reverse() and the newly created
    helper function reverse_lazy().  Fixes #628.

  * From rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Changed the way ballot discuss/comment texts are displayed to
    put the text from current ADs first, and mark ex-ADs with []
    following the convention on the left bar.  This fixes issue #608 

  * From adam@nostrum.com: 
    Added ical-format agenda.  Fixes issue #601.

  * From peter.musgrave@magorcorp.com: 
    Add IPR column to IESG Telechat Agenda.  Fixes issue #552.

  * From rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Add a defer/undefer button to the edit_position dialog.  Fixes issue #627.

  * From kivinen@iki.fi: 
    Changed cookie settings to be valid for 10 years, they used to be valid
    until the end of session.

ietfdb (3.13)

  * Provide a full URL to IPR issues in the last call email, rather than just
    the local url path.  Fixes an issue reported by Russ.

  * Tweak the admin interface for WGs and Chairs, adding some useful links 
    to the tabular displays.

  * Add refinements for the liaison admin interface.  Show contact link and 
    coloured Login/User links to show broken entries.

  * Wrap the sdo name query in a try clause to avoid server 500 errors.

  * Only try to populate the liaison user/email list from the from_entity 
    if it's set.

  * Make the document announcement default Cc: somewhat configurable.  
    Remove iab@iab.org (on request).

  * Link to the State help page from the 'State:' label.

  * Don't use '&lt;' and '&gt;' in text/plain email text.

  * Don't permit just any characters in the document name; limit this to 
    characters we currently permit in the names, or which has occurred in 
    posted documents.  Fixes a problem where non-ascii characters were 
    propagated to the database search and caused collation sequence exceptions, 
    instead of giving 404 errors.

  * Remove the To/From/Subject headers from extra headers to prevent 
    duplicate headers.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  26 Mar 2011 09:27:14 +0100

ietfdb (3.12)

  Note: Deploying this release requires a database schema update, see below.

  From esanches@yaco.es:

  * Allow an SDO Liason Manager to send outgoing liaison from any IETF
    Entity to his SDO.

  * Allow the secretariat to send liaisons on behalf of another user.

  * On login, retrieve the person record related to the login from the 
    legacy tables of non IESG logins. Provides the link between login name
    and person listed in the liaison manager table.  Fixes #576.

  * Refined handling of the To: and From: address lists when the Liaison
    Manager is also a WG Chair or AD.

  From henrik@levkowetz.com:

  * Add a clean_whitespace filter in some places to get rid of any newlines 
    embedded in document titles.  Fixes a problem with bad email headers
    in announcements related to documents with newlines embedded in the title.

  * Don't try to send out mail which has no recipients.  Fixes a crash when
    trying to send announcements related to drafts which have an empty
    'email notes to' field.

  * Fix typo in method calls to send email, fixes a crash when submitting
    liaison statements.

  * Renamed 'LiaisonDetail.taken_care' field to 'action_taken'.  
    Miscellaneous associated fixes.  Enhanced liaison-related admin pages.

  Note: Deploying this release requires an additional steps to create
    a new column in a table.  This is done as a South migration
    (see http://south.aeracode.org/ for more info on South):

    # 8<----------
    # First the regular checkout and prepare:

       cd /a/www/ietf-datatracker
       svn co http://svn.tools.ietf.org/svn/tools/ietfdb/tags/3.12
       cp web/ietf/settings_local.py 3.12/ietf/
       cd 3.12

    # Next, apply the migrations:
 
       PYTHONPATH=$PWD ietf/manage.py migrate liaisons

    # Then carry on with the usual actions:

       cd ../
       rm ./web; ln -s 3.12 web
       sudo /etc/init.d/apache restart

    # 8<----------

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  02 Feb 2011 18:34:58 +0100

ietfdb (3.11)

  * Fixed a bug in the IPR Search, where searches against the IPR notice
    content would fail (Only try to open a legacy url if it leads to a
    file; not if it leads to a directory).

  * For a new IESG tracker document, only add a history comment about
    previous history if some previous history exists (i.e., if the replaced 
    document also existed in the IESG tracker).

  * Show status of Dead Expired documents appropriately; just 'Expired' is 
    insufficient.

  * Restore, for the secretariat only, the re-scheduling functionality of 
    the /iesg/agenda/documents/ page which was removed in [2366] as the ADs 
    felt that it made the page too busy.

  * Propagate all extra fields on to the final email sending function, not 
    only the Cc and Bcc fields.  Restores previously missing Reply-To: headers.

  * Turn autoescaping off for everything in text/plain email templates.  Fixes
    multiple problems with '<' and '>' in emails showing up as '&lt;' and
    '&gt;', and related problems.

  * The liaison tool is deployed.  Show the links to the new tool.

  * Prevent things from crashing if some of the email fields are null for a 
    liaison.

  * It should be possible to edit the area of a draft even if it's been set 
    before.  Re-enabled the area list box on the document/edit/info/ page.

  * Corrected spelling error in list_display specification for the 
    PersonOrOrgInfo Admin page.

  * Corrected the path to the draft archive in the settings file.

    (Some of the fixes above has been deployed already before this release
    by patching the previous release on the server.)

ietfdb (3.10)

  * Fix css for IPR header (status column was included by mistake).  Fixes 
    issue #546.

  * Tweak some GUI strings in the Liaison Manager

  From adam@nostrum.com: 

  * Added week-at-a-time view to agenda page when viewing selected areas 
    and/or groups. If no groups are selected, the week view is hidden, leaving the
    base-level functionality unchanged. 

  From peter.musgrave@magorcorp.com: 

  * 548# Link in IPR column should use an absolute, not relative URL.  This 
    fixes issue #546.

  From kivinen@iki.fi: 

  * Added new setting to the /cookies page which enables always showing
    full document text instead of showing beginning of the document. This 
    fixes issue #551.

  From rjsparks@nostrum.com: 

  * Refined the email sent when an position changes.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  07 Dec 2010 21:39:17 +0100

ietfdb (3.09)

  From suresh.krishnan@ericsson.com: 

  * Added the last call e-mail event to the draft history page. 

  * Added a search function for drafts on their respective mailing lists.
    Fixes issue #458.

  From adam@nostrum.com: 

  * Added tarfile and pdf-composite links and functionality to download
    working group documents from the agenda page. Fixes #539

  From peter.musgrave@magorcorp.com: 

  * Added column 'IPR' to documnet table for WG docs and by AD docs, and also
    in search results. Fixes issue #497.

  From kivinen@iki.fi: 

  * Make the idea of what is 'soon' and 'new' in the I-D and RFC lists
    configurable.

  From lars.eggert@nokia.com: 

  * Fix for #467: History tab: Avoid HTTP/HTTPS warning for the diff tool form
    submission.

  * Fix for #456: Make it possible for an IESG member to add a comment (for
    the document history) in the 'change document state' dialog

  * Fix for #537: Remove redundant "by" info from doc history text.

  * Fix for #525. Adds more information to the document history tab,
    specifically changes to writeup, announcement and last-call text.

  * Fix for #372. Makes the position editing form display the name of the
    document being edited.

  * Fix for #526 and #530: Change the format of the notification email sent
    out when an AD posts a ballot position on a draft, it by default CCs that
    email to the authors and chairs, and adds some explanatory text to the body
    of those messages. 

  From rjsparks@nostrum.com: 

  * Changed the language used in the last call email to be closer to the
    language the tracker uses when no IPR declarations are found directly on the
    draft. Fixes #506

  * Retained search results on login. Fixes #482.

  * Added filename to the subject of Protocol Action and Document Action email
    messages (and fixed a bug that was preventing CC/BCC from being honored).
    Fixes issue #528.

  From fenner@fenron.net: 

  * Split the /doc/ tabs into separate pages. This fixes #533. (Eventually,
    this will use <link rel=prefetch> to ask the tabs to be prefetched when the
    first tab is loaded, as documented at
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Link_prefetching_FAQ, but as there is some
    issues with this which haven't been fully resolved, the prefetch part is not
    part of this release.)

  * Fill in the X-IETF-IDTracker header with the I-D Tracker version number.
    This fixes #513

  * Added support for admin site documentation 

  From henrik@levkowetz.com:

  * Updated IESG Agenda Section 3.3 title

  * Added fix for announcement email multipart bug, in part contributed
    by glen@amsl.com and tony@att.com.

  * Other minor fixes

ietfdb (3.08)

  From olau@iola.dk:

  * Ported scripts for expiration of drafts and last-calls, and sending
    scheduled announcements.

    The command-line front-ends are in bin/ as expire-ids, expire-last-calls
    and send-scheduled-mail. The last one already existed with some code, but
    it's not certain it actually worked. The new one accepts the same arguments
    as the Perl script (there's a little bit of help if you run it).

    All three log to syslog.  They need to be started from cron with
    PYTHONPATH=/a/www/ietf-datatracker/web , in the same manner as other
    scripts which use the django models to interact with the database.

ietfdb (3.07)

  From esanchez@yaco.es:

  * Merged in Yaco's Liaison Management Tool Port & Rewrite.  Enjoy!

  Note: Deploying this release requires additional steps; to verify
  that liaison related settings in settings.py are correct, and to create
  new tables and update existing tables and table content.  The latter
  is done as South migrations (see http://south.aeracode.org/ for more
  info on the South app).  More extensiive documentation about the actions
  needed are provided in the user manual (doc/LSMT_user_manual.pdf in
  the release).  The brief version follows:

    # 8<----------
    # First the regular checkout and prepare:

       cd /a/www/ietf-datatracker
       svn co http://svn.tools.ietf.org/svn/tools/ietfdb/tags/3.07
       cp web/ietf/settings_local.py 3.07/ietf/
       cd 3.07

    # Verify that the new variables in settings.py are correct; if not,
    # add the correct settings in settings_local.py and inform the release
    # manager of the correct settings so they can be incorporated in the
    # next release.  The variables in question are (as set in the release):
    #
    # # The email address from wich all liaison emails come:
    # LIAISON_UNIVERSAL_FROM = 'Liaison Statement Management Tool <lsmt@' + IETF_DOMAIN + '>'
    #
    # # The filesystem path where the liaison attachments will be saved:
    # LIAISON_ATTACH_PATH = '/a/www/ietf-datatracker/documents/LIAISON/'
    #
    # # The url from where the webserver serves the liaison attachments
    # LIAISON_ATTACH_URL = '/documents/LIAISON/'

    # Next, the changes to the MySQL tables will be done.
    # You can list the table migrations which will be applied if desired,
    # this should list migrations from 0001_... to 0009_... under liaisons:

       PYTHONPATH=$PWD ietf/manage.py migrate --list

    # Apply the migrations:
 
       PYTHONPATH=$PWD ietf/manage.py migrate

    # Add the static/doc location as statically served files to the apache
    # configuration.  Fix line 6 in etc/apache2/vhoosts.d/ietf-datatracker.common
    # to read:
    #  <LocationMatch "^/(?!(cgi-bin|css|documents|error|idst|images|js|media|doc|private)/|robots.txt).*$">
    # (i.e., add '|doc' to the exception list).

    # Then carry on with the usual actions:

       cd ../
       rm ./web; ln -s 3.07 web
       sudo /etc/init.d/apache restart

    # 8<----------

  Once the datatracker is up and running with the new liaison tool in
  place, liaison role assignments have to be done as described in
  the LSMT user manual (in doc/LSMT_user_manual.pdf) page 14, summarized
  by Patrik on the yaco-liaison-tool mailing list:

    1. Add the IAB and IETF chairs, wg chairs, area directors etc as
    apropriate (as described in the document).

    2. Add the liaisons in the IETF assigned and named on the IAB list of
    liaisons.

ietfdb (3.06)

  From rjsparks@nostrum.com:

  * Changed the navigation round editing ballots and sending discuss/email so
    that the user comes back to the page the edit started from.

  * Fix for ticket #374 (all in base.js) and removal of a vestigial 'save all
    changes' button from the iesg/agenda/documents page.

  * Split the ballot writeups page into three pages, for a more
    understandable user interface.

  From henrik@levkowetz.com:

  * Fix a presentation bug in /iesg/agenda/documents.txt

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  20 Sep 2010 16:45:37 +0200

ietfdb (3.05)

  Bugfix release.  Fixes the following issues (for more details, see the
  release page http://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/ietfdb/milestone/3.05)

  From olau@iola.dk:

  * #354  Document State Change Edit lacks dropdowns in IE 8

  * #359  Test cases fail in fresh checkout from iesg-tracker branch

  * #364  Impossible to move back to No-Position

  * #366  The popup view of current positions when you left click on the
    grids needs to be smarter when it doesn't fit on the display.

  * #369  IDInternal entry with missing information generated

  * #370  Documents marked for telechat not on the web agenda

  From Henrik:

  * #367  Document state age not always shown correctly

  * #355  tarfile generation fails on production system

  * #371  When a draft lacks creation date, the all_id* and 1id_*
    generating script fail

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  24 Aug 2010 15:42:30 +0200

ietfdb (3.04)

  * From Adam Roach: Make the selectable WG agenda feature of the datatracker
    IETF Agenda less resource intensive by not preloading all WG agendas.

  * From Peter Musgrave: Improve the selection of listed 'related documents'
    on the WG document pages.

  * From olau@iola.dk: Fix for issue #351 which caused server error when
    editing the state of a document (as IESG user).

  The following features were included already in v3.03, but by mistake
  weren't listed in the changelog for that revision:

  * IETF 78 Sprint code from Peter Musgrave: Add related documents section to
    the wg documents page (e.g., /wg/sipclf/).

  * IETF 78 Sprint code from Robert Sparks: Relabel the 'Issue Ballot' button
    (for AD use, on the draft info page).

  * IETF 78 Sprint code from Robert Sparks: provide a downloadable tarball of
    the documents on the IESG agenda of a given date.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  28 Jul 2010 16:13:23 +0200

ietfdb (3.03)

  * IETF 78 Sprint code from Adam Roach: Make the IETF agenda page view 
    user-modifiable, providing a custom bookmarkable agenda view for each user.

  * Make WG agendas available trough datatracker URLs; this will avoid 
    problems when the text from these pages are incorporated in frames in other 
    datatracker pages.  Example: /meeting/78/agenda/sipcore

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  27 Jul 2010 15:09:56 +0200

ietfdb (3.02)

  * Remove the per-document rescheduling dropdown boxes from the future iesg
    telechat document list (/iesg/agenda/documents/).  Fixes issue #346.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  21 Jul 2010 15:30:46 +0200

ietfdb (3.01)

  * Add a button to issue a ballot for documents which has entered IESG 
    processing but don't have a ballot yet.

  * Always make idinternal.docstate() return a string -- there are callers 
    that assume this, like the script which generates all_id2.

  * Don't fail with a server error (500) if a bad draft name (containing 
    for instance newlines) is entered -- just return a 404.

  * For WG charters under evaluation, show the year too, not only month and 
    day.  This will reveal bad date information in the charter files.

  * If we fail to parse the date of a WG charter under evaluation, use 1 
    Jan 1900, and carry on.  Don't fail with a server error.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  20 Jul 2010 18:41:31 +0200

ietfdb (3.00)

  * This release adds the IOLA port of the former Perl IESG datatracker to
    the Python/Django datatracker.  This should make most AD actions on
    drafts available through the Django datatracker, normally from the
    datatracker.ietf.org/doc/<draftname>/ page or from the /doc/ad/.../
    page, or expressed UI-wise: from the pages reached from the 'AD Dashboard'
    menu at the top of the lefthand menubar in the datatracker.  This
    includes actions such as:

    - Change draft state
    - Edit draft metadata
    - Defer ballot, undefer ballot
    - Handle ballot comments
    - Handle ballot writeups
    - Approve ballots
    - Initiate last call

    Secretariat staff actions supported through the Django datatracker now
    includes:

    - Manage telechat dates
    - Manage working group descriptions

    Tweaks to the new interface and capabilities will be releases with
    a short release cycle, as they are discovered and fixed over the next
    weeks.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  16 Jul 2010 18:14:48 +0200

ietfdb (2.52)

  * Added machine-readable ballot information (tsv and json) for drafts with
    ballots: /doc/<draftname>/ballot.tsv and /doc/<draftname>/ballot.json .
    Json data for the whole document is available for all drafts at
    /doc/<draftname>/doc.json .

  * Added Unicode NFKC normalization of paths.  Somebody just tried to access 
    /wg/ipfix/charter/ with 'fi' represented as the unicode ligature \ufb01...

  * Changed the text emitted during testing to have less noise at the
    beginning of the line -- only 'OK', 'Fail', and the initial line of coverage
    reports now starts at the beginning of the line, without whitespace.  This
    makes it easier to scan a test run visually to find reported failures.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  16 Jul 2010 13:02:46 +0200

ietfdb (2.51)

  * Add an html sanitizer and a sanitize_html template filter.  This uses
    the html5lib, which has also been included in the svn tree.

  * Provide better handling of both text/plain document comments and 
    document comments which contain html tags.  Adds urlization, 
    linebreak-preservation and html sanitization.  Html sanitization would be 
    better applied when adding comments, but we're not yet a position to 
    enforce this for all input paths.

  * Catch an additional exception which can occur during generation of 
    all_id2.txt

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  07 May 2010 12:26:58 +0200

ietfdb (2.50)

  From RjS: 

  * Don't send mail if we don't have any recipients...

  From Pasi:

  * /iesg/agenda/: fix bug related to non-existing ballots

  * Removed old (unused) YUI js/css

  * /ipr/search/: avoid exception for unexpected search types; comment out 
    debug logging

  * /doc/active, all: add link to all_id2.txt

  * /liaison/: add link to liaison statement manager tool

  * Change the text of IPR search result to more correctly reflect the 
    status of the search result when IPR has been found on documents related to 
    a listed document, but not on that document itself.

  From Pasi:

  * Use the new look for a bunch of additional pages

  * /admin/: fix login redirects to work with RemoteUserMiddleware; hide 
    password changing functionality (which doesn't work with RemoteUser anyway)

  * /ipr/: remove separate list for updating

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  21 Mar 2010 00:36:05 +0100

ietfdb (2.45)

  From Pasi:

  * Use wg_www_pages table (and removed unused idtracker_areaurl).
    Requires applying changes to database as follows:

	cd /a/www/ietf-datatracker/2.45/ietf
	PYTHONPATH=../ python manage.py dbshell < ../test/sql_fixup.sql

  * Parse stream/wg/file formats from rfc-index.xml; prepare for parsing 
    auth48 info from queue2.xml

  * IPR disclosures: Don't include .doc/.html inline; don't fail if file 
    does not exist

  * Replaced /drafts/* with redirects

  * Show datatracker version+date in new look, too

  * IESG discuss page: shade even/odd rows

  * Use new look for IETF meeting agenda; add color-coding support (like

  * For plain text RFCs, point to www.rfc-editor.org instead of www.ietf.org

  * Fix page title for 404/500 pages (ticket:298)


  From Henrik:

  * Apply django changeset 12634 to our copy, to permit usernames 
    containing '@'.  See http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/12634 .

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  11 Mar 2010 14:41:47 +0100

ietfdb (2.44)

  From Robert:

  * Moved old (1995-2003) liaison statements from the template file
    to the database. This requires applying database fixups as
    follows:

        cd /a/www/ietf-datatracker/2.44/ietf
        PYTHONPATH=../ python manage.py dbshell < ../test/liaison_fixup.sql

    And updating the liaison files as follows:

	cd /a/www/ietf-datatracker/documents/LIAISON/
        # TAKE A BACKUP OF THE WHOLE DIRECTORY, JUST IN CASE
	. /a/www/ietf-datatracker/2.44/test/liaison_fixup.sh

  From Pasi:

  * Use new look for more pages

  * Make obsoletes/updates/etc. lists links (with new urlize_ietf_docs 
    template filter)

  * Always show year in /idtracker/status/ dates

  * /doc/rfcNNNN/: show the internet-draft name (if known) and link to its 
    history; show information about post-RFC IESG processing

  * Use yellow for 'abstain' also in /iesg/agenda/documents/

  * IESG ballot grid icon: show 'abstain' as yellow instead of gray

  * Better output if /doc/ search doesn't match anything

  * Show state-change-notice-to field in /doc/ (to AD/secretariat)

  * Make IESG telechat agenda feed discoverable

  * Added IPR/dependency links and edit/add buttons for RFCs, too; some 
    template refactoring

  * Avoid exceptions from MySQL when searching for non-ASCII draft names/WG 
    acronyms/etc.

  * Handle non-ASCII characters gracefully in old cgi-bin script redirects

  * IPR search: handle non-numeric RFC numbers/ID document tags gracefully 
    (instead of uncaught exception)

  * Change Atom feeds (+couple of other places) to point to /doc/draft-.. 
    instead of /idtracker/draft-.../

  From Henrik:

  * In PersonOrOrgInfo.email(), try harder to find a relevant email address.
    The new code will eventually fall back to a broad filter which matches that
    of the perl code which creates WG charter pages, where the old code would
    sometimes result in django-generated charter pages with missing email
    addresses.

  * Serve ipr disclosures which are available on the server directly, 
    instead of through an external http link in an <iframe/>.  The <iframe/> 
    method can result in mixing https and http content in the page, which some 
    browser take issue with.

  * Add back in rudimentary Django Admin support which was lost in the 0.96 
    -> 1.1 transition.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  01 Mar 2010 13:17:16 +0100

    /idtracker/draft-foo-bar/

  * Added javascript redirect for /drafts/draft-foo-bar/ page

  * Fixed bug in submitting general license statements

  * Fixed ballot icon width problem in Safari (regression introduced in

    and according to logs nobody is using it)

  * Added rel=nofollow to various links

  * Improve coloring for "for N days" information

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  01 Mar 2010 13:05:22 +0100

ietfdb (2.42)

  From Pasi:

  * Use an ietf icon in an alternative colour for the new datatracker
    interface.

  * Document page: show IESG telechat date; show state for RFCs (if 
    applicable)

  * Move search button JavaScript to right template file

  * IESG discuss page: better switching between all/by me/for me

  * Less SQL queries for per-document page

  * Moderator package: always show last call end date, fix bug in showing 
    ballot.  Include previous minutes.

  * Show small comment icon (instead of asterisk) when ballot has text.
    Show comment icon also next to discuss/comment text

  * Use a local copy of YUI library instead of pointing to Google CDN (this 
    allows us to work with pure IPv6); upgrade to YUI 2.8.0r4

  * Make RFC editor status a link (to queue)

  * Add link to comments Atom feed

  * Right-click ballot icon to edit your position (when logged in as IESG)

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  26 Jan 2010 11:54:06 +0100

ietfdb (2.41)

  * The 'current agenda' url can fail between meetings, when the 'current 
    meeting number' has been bumped up, but not all relevant information has 
    been entered yet.  Fall back to the most recent meeting for which an agenda 
    can be produced in that case.

  * The self.affiliation() call can sometimes cause an exception, too, due 
    to the deficiencies of the database.  Use something safer as fallback.

  From Pasi:

  * Show various edit buttons only to ADs/secretariat

  * Simplify WG menu a bit

  * Fix comment handling for drafts not in idinternal; use select_related 
    to reduce SQL queries

  * Make sure DOCTYPE is first (without empty lines above it)

  * Use GZipMiddleware for per-document page (result is 25% of original, 
    and loads visibly faster)

  * Close ballot dialog if Escape is pressed

  * Fix ballot dialog not appearing (in new tracker UI)

  * Add timestamp to scribe template

  * Show ballot comments even if AD has no position

  * Improved history tab in "new tracker UI"; per-document page now works 
    better without JavaScript; internal refactoring/cleaning of per-document 
    page

  * Better abstract cleaning (to remove new-style boilerplate)

  * Cleaned/simplified left navbar in "new tracker UI"

  * Removed unused HTML (related to the old authentication system)

ietfdb (2.40)

  * Fixed bug in charter templates -- need to test that milestone.done is 
    'Done', as it can also be set to 'No'...

  From Pasi:
  * Added roll call to moderator package; added agenda package email

  * Updated moderator package texts

  * Removed unused image (for the already-retired mailing list request tool)

  * Restrict /iesg/agenda/moderator_package.html to ADs and secretariat

  * Added group_required authentication/authorization decorator

  * Minor refactoring of IESG telechat agenda management item code (to 
    allow access controlled pages in the future)

  * Fix line breaks in IESG telechat moderator package

  * Removed the now-executed commands from sql_fixup.sql

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  04 Dec 2009 12:02:12 +0100

ietfdb (2.39)

  From Pasi:

  * Replaced old authentication/authorization system with a new one
    (which uses Apache's authentication). This requires applying
    database fixups as follows:

        cd /a/www/ietf-datatracker/2.39/ietf
        PYTHONPATH=../ python manage.py dbshell < ../test/sql_fixup.sql
	PYTHONPATH=../ python manage.py syncdb

    And adding something like this to Apache configuration:

	<LocationMatch "^/accounts/login/">
        AuthType Basic
        AuthName "IETF Datatracker"
        AuthUserFile /a/www/htpasswd
	Require valid-user
	</LocationMatch>

  * Fixed ballot icon/etc. to work with the new auth/authz system

  * Added first beta of IESG telechat moderator package (not fully working 
    yet)

ietfdb (2.37)

  * With this release, the datatracker is changed to run under Django 1.1
    rather than under 0.96, and in this sense it is a major release.  There
    is however very few changes that can be seen by the users, which is the
    reason why there is no major bump in the release number.

  Major changes, from Pasi and the code sprint participants:

  * Imported django/ directory from Django-1.1.1.tar.gz, placed in parallel
    with the top-level ietf/ directory in the tree.  This lets us run with
    a version of Django which could possibly be different than the system
    installed version.

  * Automated conversion of the code base to django-1.1 conventions, e.g.
    to use max_length instead of maxlength in model declarations.

  * Lots of escape and safe filters added to the templates, to handle the
    transition from 0.96 to 1.1.  This work was contributed by a number of
    people durint the IETF 76 code sprint:
	Pasi Eronen (also leading up to the IETF 76 code sprint)
	Tony Hansen
	Ben Campbell
	Tero Kivinen
	Adam Roach
	Arifumi Matsumoto

  * Code cleanup, including removal of unused and seldomly used code (in
    particular the code for mailing list change requests)

  * A lot more test cases added, in preparation for the transition to 1.1;
    also refinement of the testing framework.

  From Lars Eggert:

  * Support the use of UTF-8 in emails

  * Fixed the IPR submission tool to work under Django 1.1

  * Handle persons with non-ASCII names correctly in Django 1.x

  * Improve test coverage for meeting/, idrfc/

  * Multiple bugfixes for days-in-state information

    because the foreign key isn't really a foreign key

  * Fix author name (Unicode) and pubdate (datetime vs. date) for Django 1.x

  * Use IDInternal.comments method to avoid foreign key problems; support 
    Unicode in jsonify_helper

ietfdb (2.32)

  * Make the 1wg-charters.txt page stable, not changing dependent on the
    order in which the database backend returns records.

  * Various fixes to the new charter page generation.  Removed the area
    prefix for secretaries (secretaries aren't area secretaries, they're
    secretaries to the group).  Added tech advisors and WG editors.
    Fixed html for secretary lists.

  * Fixed link in Slides model (should be moved to templates, I suspect)
    which has changed since ietf-74.  Todo: Should be made consistent in
    the archives, or failing that, be dependent on the meeting number
    (ugh!).

  * Cleaning of IPR disclosure submission form internals  
    to simplify Django 1.0 transition.  From Jelte and Pasi.

  * Fixed a wrong link in the html agenda (from Henrik)

  * Removed the explicit database server ip address in settings.py
    (from Henrik)

  * Integrated updated authorization system.  This requires applying
    database fixups as follows:

	cd /a/www/ietf-datatracker/2.23/ietf
	python manage.py dbshell < ../test/sql_fixup.sql

    The existing htpasswd file can be imported into this new system
    as follows:

	export PYTHONPATH=/a/www/ietf-datatracker/2.23
	export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=ietf.settings
	/a/www/ietf-datatracker/2.23/ietf/bin/import-users /a/www/htpasswd

    Please capture the output of the import-users script, as it will
    help us resolve any troubles that users have.

    refactor and simplify the agenda code and templates.  Requires some database
    changes, too.

  * Made the liaison statement list inherit from base.html, to have the same style

  * Changed to table layout for the base page.  Not puristic, but the non-table
    approach had problems with some pages, (some content being forced to start
    below the lefthand menu even when there was space higher up), and I could see
    no easy way to fix it.

  * Added the text from the original IPR declaration to the detail page for
    declarations submitted by mail.  Made the link to the email text page more
    prominent. Fixed some html issues.

  * Added a link to the meeting agenda to the lefthand menu, and did some minor
    fixes to the html.

  * Added more people to the autogenerated release mail.

    version of drafts)

  * Added to the mkrelease script the generation of a mail about the
    release to various interested parties.

  * Changed the IDtracker's 'not in the tracker' error message, as it
    sounded a bit as if there was no record of the draft in question.

    from Pasi Eronen <pasi.eronen@nokia.com>

    hardcoded IP address when it should be empty.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  06 Nov 2008 17:20:49 +0100

ietfdb (2.11)

    menu-bar.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  06 Nov 2008 17:20:49 +0100

ietfdb (2.10)

  * Changed look-and-feel of the datatracker, by introducing a different
    style sheet, and using a more consistent style, and introducing a
    lefthand menubar.

    information.  Tweaked the format of returned docstate information
    to not have spaces around the :: separator between state and substate.

  * Fixed the help page for ballot symbols, which had a very old text
    which no longer was correct.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  06 Nov 2008 17:20:49 +0100

  * Adjustments to the default settings, to match the new deployment environment
    at AMS

  * Template updates for agendas: 
      - Use python, not template-language, to decide if the month is
	different.  
      - Don't use "odate" and add a space where   appropriate.  
      - Use a datetime and time zone instead of hardcoding (ET).
	(let the model combine the date and the time)

  * Per suggestion from John Klensin, add a link directly to the text of the
    I-D, but only give the explicit link to the draft if it's active.

  * Expanded description of a document on the agenda.

  * Added authorization infrastructure.  No impact on current functionality,
    but needed for future features.

  * Added a feed for documents on the IESG telechat.  Improved the admin
    interface for iesg_login and irtf rg's and chairs.

  * /meeting/ now redirects to meeting/<current>/materials.html

  * Licencing information added.  IETF Trust copyright added as needed.
