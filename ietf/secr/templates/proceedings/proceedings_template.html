This is a unique template in the Secretariat Django project in that it does not extend
the standard base templates.  Instead we include proceedings_header.html and
proceedings_footer.html which are used in the PHP apps.
Note this section should begin with
<td id="content1"><div id="content2">
and end with
</div></td></tr>

<td id="content1"><div id="content2">

{% block content %}{% endblock %}


</div></td></tr>

{% include "includes/proceeding_footer.html" %}
