<h2>Explanation of Discusses</h2>
<hr>
<pre>
The process that the IESG uses for recording and documenting issues
with documents is called an Evaluation.  Evaluations provide a
mechanism for ensuring that each AD has the opportunity to review each
document and to keep track of who has (and has not) yet completed an
evaluation for a particular document.

The ballot options for all normal evaluations are:

- "Yes" means "I read it, I think it's good stuff, make it so."

- "No Objection" means "I would not object if this document went forward".

examples where No Objection might be used include:
- I read it & have no problem with it
- I read the protocol action & trust the AD so have no problem
- I listened to the discussion and have no problem

This may be interpreted as "I have no clue or have no cycles",
in that you exercise the ability to move a document forward on the
basis of trust towards the other ADs

- "Discuss" means "I cannot in good conscience send this document forward,
but if it were fixed in these ways, I would change my vote to 'yes' or no
objection'", or it may literally mean "I think we need to talk about this."

Text explaining the "discuss" must be written at the time that the "discuss"
is placed, saved in the tracker, and sent by email to all affected parties
(at least the IESG, the document shepherd, and the document author(s), and quite
likely the WG too).

Valid criteria for a "discuss" are documented separately.

A "discuss" is not intended to be a blocking tactic, but a way to
cause significant improvement in a draft. If we have a legitimate
issue with a draft, we should return the document to the working
group (or author) for resolution of the problem as quickly as possible.
If an AD cannot get cooperation from the working group and cannot vote to
send a document forward, he or she should switch to "abstain".

- "Abstain" means "I cannot vote to send this document forward."
There are two obvious reasons one might vote this way:
- so strongly opposed to document that I am unwilling to "discuss".
(note that this should be very unusual)
- I oppose this document for some philosophical reason but
understand that others differ and am not going to stand
in the way of the others

- "Recuse" means "I cannot vote due to a personal interest in the document"
The AD is a document author, working group chair, or otherwise
interested party

- "Defer" - give me a stated amount of time - one telechat cycle, two
with the consent of the chair - to read the document. Other discussion
may and presumably will continue, but no decision will be reached until
the agreed time has elapsed or the requesters have all changed their
votes, whichever happens earlier. "Defer" should be avoided as much as
possible.

It takes one "yes", with at least 2/3 of all non-recused ADs voting "yes" or
"no objection", and no "discuss" votes to move a document forward.

The IESG secretary will refer to the ballot during the telechat, and poll
anyone who has not recorded an opinion. This is somewhat time consuming. It
is much better to enter your ballot in advance, and circulate important
comments and "Discuss" text in advance. If a Discuss can be cleared by email
before the telechat, everybody wins. During the telechat, the secretary will
tally the scores and announce the result, leaving us more time for the
knottier issues or (yes, it has happened) the ability to end the call early.

Alternative procedure, invoked by the chair in the event that the IESG
deadlocks in the above process:

- all ADs must read the document by a time stated.
- the vote is up-down -
"yes" means "I read it and it is good stuff"
"no" means "I read it and it is not good stuff"
"abstain" means "I read it but I do not feel qualified to comment
"recused" is as above

In this case, 2/3 of all non-recused ADs must vote "yes" and not more than two ADs may
vote "no". Continued deadlock sends it back to the working group.
