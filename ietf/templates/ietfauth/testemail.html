<h1>Set up test email address</h1>

<p>Since this server is running in test mode, all email to be sent out

<p>To receive a copy of each message before it's thrown away, you can
set an email address below. The address is stored in the <code>testmailcc</code>
cookie in your browser. So make sure cookies are enabled.</p>

<p>Value of <code>testmailcc</code>: {{ cookie }}</p>
