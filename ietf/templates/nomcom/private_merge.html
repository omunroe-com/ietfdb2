  <h2>Merging nominee email addresses</h2>
  <p>
   If a nominee has been nominated with multiple email addresses, the nominee will
   appear multiple times in the nomination list, as the email address is used as
   the unique identifier for each nominee.  In order to permit comments and nominations
   to be submitted under multiple email addresses, there is a list of secondary email
   addresses which needs to be kept up-to-date.  When nominations of one particular nominee
   have already been made under different email addresses, the nomination comments from the
   secondary address also needs to be merged with those under the primary address.
  </p>
  <p>
    It doesn't matter particularly which email address is used as primary, as far as the
    nominee information maintenance goes, but it's probably handier for the nomcom if the
    primary address is the one which the nominee prefers at the time.
