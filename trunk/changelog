  **Liaison tool rewrite**

  This release merges in work from rcross@amsl.com and esanchez@yaco.es which
  provides a major rewrite of the IETF datatracker liaison support.  It
  introduces a simplified user interface, new improved and reworked data
  models, liaison statement history, improved handling of liaison-related
  emails in many ways, generalisations of liaison sender and recipient
  handling, making the tool much more flexible, improved search, status
  overview and attachment handling, and a greatly expanded test coverage.

  This work was funded by the IAOC.  The statement of work is available here:

  **Serve static assets via CDN**

  This release adds support for serving static files through a CDN, rather
  than having them served by the datatracker webserver.  This will both
  offload the datatracker webserver and speed up retrieval of static files.

  By default, all external static assets (such as jquery, bootstrap,
  font-awesome, qunit, select2) are served via CDN, while the datatracker's
  own static files are not.  It is expected that the more stable datatracker
  static files will be migrated to be served via CDN also, over time.

  This release also adds support for easy update of external javascript, font,
  and css libraries by means of a new management command "bower_install" which
  makes use of the "bower" package manager.  Use of this management command
  requires that bower be installed on the development platform.  

  When deploying this and following releases, a new action is needed in order
  to make the appropriate static content available for serving via CDN:

  After checking out the release, before creating the symlink to the new release
  in the datatracker deployment directory, it is now also necessary to run
  the "collectstatic" action::

    $ ietf/manage.py collectstatic

  A note about that has been added to the README file in the datatracker
  deployment directory.

  **Active area, directorate, team, and area group pages**

  This release provides new group overview pages for active areas, area
  groups, teams, and directorates.  It also improves the error reporting when
  drafts are submitted with invalid XML, providing line numbers and specifics
  for the issues found.  Additionally, there are a few bug fixes.

  * Merged in [9924] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Added views of active areas, area groups, teams, and directorates.  Added
    navigation to those views to the base menus.  Unified the URL patterns
    shared between group/urls and group/urls_info, exposing the same view at,
    e.g., /group/stir and /wg/stir/.  Improved testing, primarily of
    group/info.py 

  * Merged in [9901] from rcross@amsl.com:
    Fixed matching audio file names with rooms.   

  * Provided a document's rfc number (if any) as part of the document fields 
    exposed in the json api.

  * Changed the code for meta-data extraction from xml files to not break 
    if a sought-after element is missing.

  * Updated the meta-data error message to say 'errors ... below' instead of
    'errors ... above', to match the relative placement of text and error
    indications.

  * Improved the error reporting for invalid xml file submissions.

  * Improved the handling of failed xml2rfc conversions when no txt document
    is submitted.

  **XML-Only Draft Submission**

  style, text and bug fixes from Lars Eggert, and improvements to the ability to
  accept draft replacement information at drafts submission time.

    Moved state length notification after RFC Editor status (looks better).

ietfdb (6.0.3) ietf; urgency=medium

  This release provides the capability to manage and graphically
  schedule additional meeting types, including leadership meetings.  It

    info pages.  Fixes issue #1651.

  * Removed a number of action buttons which aren't relevant for RFCs.  
    Fixes issue #1698.

    Also fixed a 'missing columns' html warning. Fixes issue #1697.

  * Merged in [9608] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Show leadership when and where mail was sent at the time it is sent.  

  * Fixed a problem with nomcom classification forms showing too many 
    fields.

  * Tweaked the missing id submission revision message to work also with 
    non-ascii characters in the draft name.  Changed the disallowed character 
    error message to be more useful by providing the found document name and 
    byte codes for the disallowed characters.

  * Updated the api resources file with new meeting model fields.

  * Merged in [9604] from rcross@amsl.com:
    Updated the IAOC email address in Announcement app.   

  * Merged in [9603] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:

    - Added functionality which allows the secretariat to manage more meeting 
      types, including leadership meetings.
    - Backfilled those types of meetings from IETF91 and IETF92.
    - Addressed several facelift issues in the meeting application.

  * Merged in [9595] from rcross@amsl.com:
    Fixed an issue where an authorized individual was unable to add an
    incoming liaison.  Fixed a problem with the incoming liaison form
    requiring a deadline date for information only statements.

    specifiers.

    to the release script.

  * Added 5 migrations for changes in model field help-text strings which
    changed in the facelift.  Also fixed the expression of the help text for
    NomCom.reminder_interval so the text itself doesn't contain quite as much
    whitespace.

  * Aligned the table header fields with the table columns in the doc history
    page.  Marked the action text safe so as to make embedded links show up as
    links.

  * Reduced the max height of submenus to avoid them extending below the screen
    bottom edge when used from the top navbar (which won't scroll).  The new
    value works on 1024x768 screens for the current areas.

    Don't show concluded groups in the community list section of the 
    navbar. Fixes bug #1652.  

  * Removed local copies of html5lib and tastypie, and updated
    requirements.txt to include them.  Removed typogrify from the requirements

    development or test mode.  Fixes issue #1667.

  * Added back the development mode header on the frontpage.

  * Adapted session_draft_list() code to handle the case when there is 
    multiple agendas for a given group acronym.  Fixes some server 500 results 
    when trying to get pdf bundles for the plenary sessions for ietf 71.

  * Put back the schema specifier for IANA and RFC-editor URLs -- they are 
    needed in parts of the code.

  * Put back the value attribute for the name/value pair of many input and
    button elements which lost the value attribute in the conversion, in order
    to let the backing form code determine which button was pressed.  Fixes
    issue #1668.

  * Shaved off some more vertical space in the document tables.  Builds on 
    [9494], addresses #1660, #1663, #1665.

  * Introduced a couple of changes to the document list row format to make 
    rows take up less vertical space: Moved the page count in under the date, 
    so it won't add vertical space, and made shepherd email addresses break 
    across lines if needed, instead of squashing the column widths of the other 
    columns.

  * Made it clearer on the document iesg review page and the ballot popup 
    page which ADs mentioned are ex-ADs, by adding parentheses in addition to 
    the dimmed text.  Fixes issue #1664

  * Removed all subsection horizontal lines from the document meta tables, 
    on suggestion from mnot@pobox.com.  Addresses issue #1659.

  * Added a missing templatetag library load instruction for bootstrap3.  
    Addresses issue #1662.

  * Replaced google-served fonts with self-hosted ones.  After a testing
    period with the current 'access plus 4 hours' Cache-Control setting,
    we should probably increase the cache control for external static files.

  **Facelift using Bootstrap**

  During more than a year, from July 2013 to late 2014, Lars Eggert,
  <lars@netapp.com>, has worked intensively on a major facelift to the
  datatracker, porting the GUI to Bootstrap. The work took 287 separate
  commits , and comprised changes to 1016 different files.

  This work has turned the IETF Datatracker website into a responsive website
  which support use on a much larger variety of devices, from small mobile
  devices to desktops.

  The work relies heavily on the capabilities of Bootstrap, and continues to
  use the Django framework which the datatracker has been build on since
  version 2.00.

  Additional page conversion work has been done by Ole Laursen, with final
  style tweaks, bug-fixes and adaptations by Henrik Levkowetz in order to take
  care of some remaining rough edges and give it a distinct colour palette and
  a matching selection of fonts.

  The fonts, PT Serif for body text, PT Sans Caption for headers, PT Sans for
  menus, and PT Mono for monospaced documents are from ParaType, and are
  served by Google Fonts.

ietfdb (5.13.1) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is a bugfix release, to have a clean slate before merging in the
  Bootstrap facelift for 6.0.0.  Details:

  * Merged in [9428] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Properly mark (and test) older ballot comment and discuss text after a new
    revision is submitted. Fixes bug #1656.  

  * Merged in [9426] from rcross@amsl.com:
    Add several 'From' options for IAD user of announcement tool.   

  * Merged in [9375] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Put old style slides directly into archived. Migrate IETF92 materials to
    match.  

  * Merged in [9351] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Removed sessonly, replacing the idea with a separate State. Add tests
    checking how materials show on agenda views.  

  * Fixed style attributes which resulted in red text on red background for
    some error messages

  * Buildbot changes: Separated out the schedulers for trunk, personal/\*and
    branch/\*.  Corrected regex patterns which extract unittest details.  Added
    a first tentative email notifier.  Added ForceSchedulers, in order to be
    able to force builds.

  * Changed all explicitly set HttpResponse content_types to specify charset.
    Django sets charset if you don't specify a content_type; if you specify
    one you also must add a charset specification (if you want one).  Fixes
    issue #1647.

  * Fixed a typo in the sort key generation for the sort on ipr count in
    document search results.

  * Updated release data and mkrelease support, which calculates the 
    release coverage snapshot without invoking tests that developers won't 
    ordinarily be able to run on their laptops/work machines.

  **IETF 92 Code Sprint**

  This release contains the datatracker bugfixes and enhancements from the
  IETF-92 Code Sprint.  It improves the coverage of the test suite, and also
  fixes a number of issues.  Many thanks to everyone that contributed!

  * Merged in [9330] from rcross@amsl.com:
    Cleanup legacy IPR models.  Fixes ticket #1626.  

  * Merged in [9326] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Test coverage improvement for group material management.  

  * Fixed a problem in Document.meeting_related(), and fixed a number of 
    tests which broke when slide objects started to return True to 
    meeting_related() without being related to a session.

  * Merged in [9319] from kivinen@iki.fi:
    Added test cases for cookie code. This will test all the cookie setting 
    code, and also adds test for draft for include_text and full_draft cookie 
    checking.  

  * Merged in [9317] from jmh@joelhalpern.com:
    Added some nomcom test cases.  

  * Changed the MEDIA_URL to use https instead of http, to be in line with 
    other efforts to move to https in general.

  * Merged in [9316] from willem@nlnetlabs.nl:
    Test fetching of wg and rg document dependency graphs.

    Also added conditional running of these tests, as they depend on the
    availability of the dot, unflatten and ps2pdf binaries, which may not
    be available on all developers' systems.

  * Merged in [9309] from tjw.ietf@gmail.com:
    Fixed #845. Commit read for merge. 

  * Merged in [9305] from willem@nlnetlabs.nl:
    Callback API test code paths 

  * Merged in [9307] from rcross@amsl.com:
    Improved test coverage of secr.drafts.   

  * Merged in [9306] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Added pre-ads to .ad aliases. Keep draft aliases for drafts that have 
    become RFCs for some time.  

  * Merged in [9303] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Cached the wg-charter*txt pages for a time since they are very heavy to 
    generate.

ietfdb (5.12.3) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is a minor bugfix release which also addresses a number of testing
  issues, in preparation for the IETF-92 sprint on Saturday.

  * Merged in [9242] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Restores add-to-community-list functionality to several pages. Fixes 
    #1601.  

  * Added a --logfile switch to the test crawler, in order to be able to 
    control whether a logfile should be used or not.  It's not particularly 
    hepful when running on a buildbot slave, which catches stdout anyway.

  * Updated the nomcom tests to use temporary test directories for data, 
    instead of the regular production settings in settings.py.

  * Updated the mergeready script to check if the 'test:unittest' property 
    has been set to 'passed' on a changeset marked 'ready for merge'.

  * Introduced a more correct implementation of the workaround to skip
    migrations during test, which also points at the code that makes this work
    at the moment.

  * Tweaked the settings_sqlitetest.py file, which normally is used during
    test suite runs, to avoid a minutes-long stepping through migrations for
    each test run.   This makes it much more workable to run individual tests.

  * Added the buildbot config file to the repository.  Deployment path: 
    trac.tools.ietf.org:/home/buildbot/masters/datatracker/master.cfg

  * Added exception capture and error message output to the coverage_changes
    management command when the --release switch to specifies a release for
    which there isn't any data.  Also tweaked the diff output for code
    coverage changes.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  19 Mar 2015 23:55:45 +0000


ietfdb (5.12.2) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Added test coverage data to the release pages if available for the shown
    release.  Added saving of html pages for the code coverage to a directory 
    in the static files area.  If a code coverage report is available, a link 
    to it will be shown on the release page of the current release.  Renamed 
    some setting variables related to test coverage to be more explicit and 
    precise.

  * Changed the handling of some test directory creation and removal code, to
    be more consistent.  Fixed a problem with a test that didn't create and
    remove a test directory which it used.

  * Merged in [9185] from rcross@amsl.com:
    Add DocEvent and SubmissionEvent to merge-person-records.   

  * Added tests for the presence of a VTIMEZONE section in generated agenda 
    iCalendar files.

  * Started the code coverage measurements earlier, in order to make the 
    apparent code coverage of model files less confusing.

  * Added a fudge factor to the coverage test, in order to make it easier 
    to do minor code changes without slipping under the coverage of the
    latest release.

  * Made the test runner try multiple port numbers for the SMTP server, in 
    order to handle the case where multiple test suites are in progress on the 
    same host (which can happen when multiple buildbot slaves are running tests 
    at the same time).

  * Fixed a small issue with the filter expression to select ADs for active 
    groups.

  **Extended test coverage support, active email address fixups**

  This is a minor release which contains a number of bugfixes, and also
  introduces additional test coverage measurements and support functionality.
  It further contains two migrations which fixes a set of inactive email
  addresses which most likely should have been active, and notifies the owners
  about the change.  This means that when running migrations as part of this
  release, about 1000 notification emails will be sent out from the
  datatracker.

  Detailed changes:

  * Don't set email addresses which are created when a draft is submitted
    to inactive any more.  We now have a 'primary' field to indicate which
    email address is the primary one when a person has multiple registered
    addresses, so we don't have to rely on the timestamps on the email
    address objects to determine the primary address.

  * Added a migration which changes the active bit from False to True to 
    all email addresses associated with active drafts, and sends out 
    notification emails about this.

  * Added a managment command to show the difference in coverage data 
    between the latest release and the latest test run, and a test for the same.

  * Added a login requirement for the full document and group email alias 
    pages, but kept the individual group and document email-alias pages visible 
    without login.  Added testing of login redirects for the full email alias 
    lists, and reordered the test sequence within the test methods 
    appropriately.

  * Made sure that Email.__unicode__() will return a string even if address 
    is None.  Fixes an exception on deleting an email address for a Person 
    object in the admin interface.

  * Added per-app coverage measurements, to make the numbers shown when not 
    running the full tests suite a bit more meaningful.

  * Changed the nomcom.forms.FullFeedbackFormSet to use 
    modelformsets_factory() instead of direct subclassing, in order to avoid a 
    crash when using the form, caused by a missing instance attribute.

  * Clarified the meaning of checked/unchecked boxes in front of the email 
    addresses on the account profile management page.

  * Merged in [9143] from rcross@amsl.com:
    Add AG Secretary to Proceedings authorized roles.   

  * Merged in [9142] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Avoid creating blank line before headers on IPR notification email. 
    Fixes #1609.  

  * Merged in [9141] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Fix ordering issue on agenda.html.  

  * Added a new field 'primary' to the Email model, added a matching 
    migration, and a data migration to set primary fields to match the way a 
    primary address is chosen today.

  * Added a migration which captures the changed information for the
    idsubmission-cutoff-related fields of Meeting.

  * Removed the obsolete field Group._ad, and added a migration for the 
    change.

  * Added exception handling in tastypie for a case which can occur if one 
    tries to filter by regex on a FK.

  * Turned the api.py file into a module.  Moved the makeresources 
    management command to the api module.  Added some api tests.  Added 
    crawling of api files to the test-crawler.  Adjusted some resource files 
    discovered by the test suite and test-crawler.  Removed a bunch of empty 
    model files.

  **Test coverage tests**

  This release provides measurement of how much of the code is being exercised
  by our test suite, by integrating the 'coverage.py' tool in the test suite
  itself.  The percentage of the code excercised by the test suite is compared
  with the figure from the latest release, and a lower coverage constitutes a
  test failure.  This way it shouldn't be possible to add new code without
  also adding tests, without getting a test suite failure.  This should
  encourage gradually increasing levels of test suit coverage :-)

  Additionally, similar measurements and comparisons have been added for
  template and URL coverage of the test suite; these also have been
  implemented as tests, and sinking coverage of templates or URLs in the
  test suite will result in tests failures, in the same way as for code
  coverage.

  The results of the test suit coverage of code, templates, and URLs is saved
  to disk, in order to make the coverage details available for inspection.
  Coverage data per source file/template/URL is available in json format in
  a file 'coverage-latest.json' in the working directory, and more detailed
  per-line code coverage data is available in a file '.coverage', which is
  readable by the standalone 'coverage' program from 'coverage.py' from
  http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/.

  * Merged in personal/henrik/v5.11.1-dev0@9103, which provides new tests
    for the test suite's code coverage, template coverage, and URL coverage.

  This is a minor release with a few additional bugfixes:

  * Merged in [9121] from rcross@amsl.com:
    Resolved some issues with the proceedings progress repport.

  * Merged in [9099] from rcross@amsl.com:
    Added an ietf/bin script, merge-person-records.   

  * Merged in [9097] from rcross@amsl.com:
    Editing session request causes KeyError.  Fixes #1605.

  * Changed the handling of the group edit form so as to generate a 
    ChangeStateGroupEvent for state changes, instead of a generic GroupEvent of 
    type 'info_changed'.

ietfdb (5.11.1) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is a minor release, providing bugfixes and some enhancements.
  Worth mentioning is pages which lets one view and search the draft- and
  wg- email alias lists, the ability to control draft submission cutoff
  individually per meeting, improved presentation of the submission cutoff
  times, and release content annotations for major releases back to 2010
  on the release overview page.  Details below:

  * Added a slightly tweaked version of timedelta, in order to support 
    handling of TimedeltaFields.

  * Made the selector for Agenda.groups() match that of Agenda.area_list() 
    by adding parent__isnull=False.  Without this, the two won't match if split 
    by area.  Fixes issue #1607.

  * Added 4 new fields to the meeting class, to hold draft submission 
    cutoff information for the meeting.  On request, changed the presentation 
    of the cutoff times to show the last submission time, rather than the 
    beginning of the cutoff time. Changed the cutoff hour format to support 
    full timedelta information, not just a given hour (this was necessary in 
    order to be able to set the requested 23:59:59 submission stop time).

  * Merged in [9083] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Added dealing with /wg/foo/email-aliases, /wg/email-aliases, and 
    similar for /rg. Added an initial test suite for all invocations of the 
    email_alias views.  

  * Merged in [9070] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Adds pages to view the draft and group email aliases, either as a 
    whole, or per document or group.  

  * Added newly generated .ics timezone snippets, from
    http://www.ietf.org/timezones/tzdata-latest.tar.gz.  This updates the .ics
    files to use timezone information current as of 13 Feb 2015.

  * Modified the vzic makefile to generate new zoneinfo data by fetching 
    the latest tzdata file from ietf.org/timezones/tzdata-latest.tar.gz and 
    running vzic to update the .ics files as needed.

  * Don't create empty Alias records. Fixes issue #1603.

  * Added a guard against crashing because of missing timeslot location or 
    time in check_audio_files(), which is called by create_proceedings() after 
    changes to meeting materials.  Fixes issue 1604.

  * Added back a functioning get_fieldsets() method, which was removed 
    instead of corrected in the Django 1.7 upgrade.

  * Added a missing table column to the WG document page for the case when 
    the user isn't logged in.  Addresses issue #1601 (but add links in the 
    column are still missing).

  * Added title annotations to major release entries in the changelog back 
    to 2010, and changelog parsing and release page support for the same.

  **Django 1.7**

  This release upgrades Django from 1.6.4 to 1.7.1, and tastypie from 0.11.1 to
  0.12.1.  It changes the database migrations infrastructure from that provided
  by "south", to the builtin replacement newly introduced with Django 1.7.

  There are also a number of changes which are required by the upgrade, in
  order to make things work as expected, and some fixes to bugs revealed by
  the improved infrastructure provided by Django 1.7.

  Deployment note:  

    When deploying this, migrations need some extra care, as the new-style
    migrations which are part of the release should not actually be run -- they
    are there to provide a status snapshot as a basis for future migrations.

    In order to handle this, please use the --fake option when running migrations
    for this particular release:

	$ ietf/manage.py migrate --fake

  * Merged in [9005] from rcross@amsl.com:

    - Fixed the group link on the standalone Interim Meeting Proceedings
      directory page.

    Also removed some dead code.

  * Removed the unnecessary get_and_create() of
    community.model.DisplayConfiguration on community page GET.

  * Made the cookie handling for the 'new_enough' and 'expires_soon' cookies
    insensitive to nonnumeric values.

ietfdb (5.10.2) ietf; urgency=medium

  * When draft email aliases are generated, the content of the doc.notify
    field is used to generate the $draft.notify alias, and is also included in
    the $draft.all alias.  If the notify field contains either the .notify
    alias or the .all alias, this can create a mail loop.  Changed the alias
    generation code to expand (or ignore, for .notify) aliases found in the
    notify field, and changed the code which fills in the notify field with a
    default value to insert the author, ad, and shepherd aliases instead of
    the .all alias.

  * Merged in [8970] from olau@iola.dk:
    Enabled support for a custom settings file for the test crawler and added
    a simple settings file that enables caching to speed up the crawl (shaves
    ~35% off most pages, it seems) 

  * Merged in [8961] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Avoid an issue with python.email breaking To header field values that it
    has to encode in bad places. Fixes #1589.  

  * Merged in [8949] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Improvements to the fix to #1592.  

  * Merged in [8948] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Capture out-of-area ADs in draft and group aliases. Fixes #1592.  

  * Merged in [8924] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Restrict the gathering of ads for past meetings to groups that are areas.

  * Merged in [8923] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:

  This is a release containing a large number of small fixes and enhancements,
  as follows:

  * Merged in [8879] from rcross@amsl.com:
    Grant hte IRTF Chair access to proceedings.  Fixes #1580.  

  * Merged in [8870] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Inform the secretariat when a duplicate Alias.name is created that isn't
    already a duplicate Person.name. Improve the message that's sent when
    either duplicate Person or Alias names are detected.  

  * Merged in [8861] from rcross@amsl.com:
    Changes to allow upload of bluesheets in materials upload page.  Primarily
    for use with Interim meetings.  

  * Merged in [8856] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Show out-of-area ads on /wg/. Fixes #1555. Related to #1557.  

  * Merged in [8855] from rcross@amsl.com:
    Fixed the Back and Cancel buttons in recording views.  Fixes #1577.

  * Merged in [8854] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    This is the second step towards ADs out of GroupInfo into Role.
    The use of group.ad has been scrubbed from the code and templates.

    - Those places that set group.ad have been directly manipulate Role 
      objects instead

    - Most places that read group.ad now use a new group.ad_role() that 
      returns a Role object, simplifing some views.

    Related to #1555 and #1557. 

  * Merged in [8853] from rcross@amsl.com:
    Fixed audio recordings which weren't showing in the proceedings.  

  * Merged in [8852] from rcross@amsl.com:
    Fixed the ability to replace minutes and agendas.  

  * Merged in [8851] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    This is the first step towards using Role to represent Area directors. It

    - Migrates the information captured in GroupInfo.ad to Role objects.

    - Renames GroupInfo.ad to GroupInfo._ad (retaining the current column name) 
      to prepare for deletion of that field.

    - Provides ad property accessor and setter methods implemented using the 
      group's role_set (so that the existing view code continues to work with 
      minimal changes)

    - Improved selection in many querysets that assumed only groups of type 
      'area' would have area directors.

    Related to #1557 and #1555. 

  * Merged in [8850] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Changed the permission guards on edit_notify to reflect the policy that
    #1517 tried to establish.  Fixes #1517 and #1575.  

  * Merged in [8849] from rcross@amsl.com:
    Fixed several issues with IPR references in iesg templates.  

  * Merged in [8848] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Don't add the group's ad to the list of people who need to be at a meeting
    if the group doesn't have an ad. Protects the field formatter from
    occurances of None in passed in lists. Patch applied to production.  

  * Merged in [8846] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Added tests for document urls that provide a revision for all the document
    types the view code currently handles. Refactored parts of Document and
    DocHistory into DocumentInfo to get the tests to pass.  (but careful
    review is probably warranted). 

  * Merged in [8845] from rcross@amsl.com:
    Allowed editing of legacy disclosures which don't have required fields
    (set required=False).  

  * Merged in [8843] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Reworked the definition of future_presentations and last_presented. Fixes
    #1571.  

  * Merged in [8842] from rcross@amsl.com:

  **Enhanced IPR Support**

  This release provides work from rcross@amsl.com which refactors and enhances
  the IPR support in the datatracker.  Here is an overview of the changes:

  * Updated and streamlined the database models representing IPR disclosures,
    and migrated existing data to the new models.

  * Added a new admin interface with better support for listing IPR
    disclosures and searching them.

  * Improved the Secretariat's navigation between IPR document views/search
    results and the administrative pages to edit IPR documents.

  * Introduced the ability for a disclosure submission to indicate it is
    updating more than one existing disclosure.

  * Improved the Secretariat's management interface for the 'Waiting for
    Approval' queue, and added the ability to park disclosures that are
    waiting for approval.

  * Added a Secretariat management interface for rejected and removed
    disclosures.

  * Implemented simplified forms for Secretariat updates to a disclosure.

  * Added support for managing the email communication necessary for
    processing a submission.

  The streamlined models and related coding decisions has resulted in a
  reduction in the LOC (lines of code) count by about 2000 lines, at
  the same time as the functionality has improved.  Cool :-)

  **Enhanced Team Support**

  * Merged in [8711] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:

    of type 'team':

    - Simplifies managing the Abstract for uploaded group materials. Displays
      the abstract on the groups materials page

    - Provides SessionPresentation: a binding between Document and Session
      objects, that tracks doc version.

    - Adds helpers for finding upcoming sessions, and the most recent
      SessionPresentations whose sessions have passed

    - Generalizes the snippet concept (as a templatetage) used in the history
      tab for use on other pages

    - Adds a variant of the snippet that can be styled as an edit link

    - Provides several ways to address sessions, using sequence, dates, group
      acronyms, and day of week

  **JSON Api**

  This release introduces a machine-readable API to the datatracker database
  content, based on Tastypie (https://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org/).

  Currently the API is set to read-only; but Tastypie does support
  fine-grained control of create, read, update, and delete permissions, so if
  we find that it makes sense at some point, we can open up for authenticated
  access to more than just reading database content.

  The details of which tables and objects from the database that are exposed
  in the API are controlled by a series of resources.py files; one per Django
  app.  By default, no data is exposed; in order to expose a table, the
  resources file must contain a resource specification, in the form of a
  python class which determines which table fields should be exposed, and how.

  Since we want to expose almost all the database content, rather than only a
  few selected tables, there is a lot of code which needs to be specified
  (more than 200 classes, with almost 2000 lines, at this writing) in order
  to make data available through the API.

  Rather than manually type out all of the needed classes, a management
  command (ietf/manage.py makeresources) has been added which will generate
  the needed resource classes in the resources.py files automatically.
  Existing classes will be left intact, though, which makes it feasible to
  hand tune the classes if needed, but still auto-generate resource classes
  when new tables are added.

  In addition to read access to the exposed tables and objects, the Tastypie
  API provides support for automated discovery of the available tables.  Starting
  at the URL https://datatracker.ietf.org/api/v1/, the returned machine-readable
  data provides URL information for all available API endpoints, which makes it
  possible to recurse down to all available data.

  Data is currently provided in JSON and XML format.  Adding new formats is
  fairly easy, if it should be found desriable.

ietfdb (5.7.2) ietf; urgency=medium

  Another bugfix release, containing a number of fixes for issues related to
  extraction of meta-information from draft submissions, and also fixes for
  some other blemishes not discovered at the time of 5.2.1.  This release
  also enhances the generation of draft author aliases, providing a 
  {draftname}.shepherd alias which points to the shepherd (if set), and adding
  the shepherd email address to the {draftname}.all alias.  The email alias
  changes will take effect as soon as the aliases are activated for @ietf.org
  (as opposed to @tools.ietf.org).  Details:

  * Addedd a temporary patch for an unwanted exception which occurred when
    trying to generate proceedings for a session which didn't have an
    assigned timeslot in an official schedule.  Happens all the time for
    interims, for example.

  * Merged in [8506] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Changed the default notify address for IRTF stream documents. Fixes bug
    #1489.

  * Merged in [8505] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Added code to allow removing a document shepherd, and test that it works.
    Fixes bug #1509.  

  * Merged in [8504] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Added tests that would have caught bug #1508. Added message to
    edit_shepherd_email to match that added in edit_shepherd.  

  * Merged in [8498] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Reworked logic flow for editing shepherds. Added message to inform the 
    user when the shepherd is not changed. Fixes bug #1508.  

  * Changed the signature line of the generate-wg-aliases script so as to show
    the script path instead of a manually maintained string (which had become
    outdated) in the signature string at the top of the generated files.

  * Added generation of {draftname}.shepherd aliases for drafts when 
    generating draft email aliases, and also added the shepherd's email address 
    to the {draftname}.all alias.  Changed the signature line of the script to 
    give the script path instead of a manually maintained string (which had 
    become outdated).

  * Fixed a bug in setting the can_edit_shepherd_writeup flag, triggered by the 
    change in what Document.shepherd refers to (now, Email, used to be Person).

  * Added 'Dr.-Ing.' to the recognised honorifics in the author extraction 
    code.

  * Did a number of changes to the author extraction method of class Draft 
    in order to make it able to match up names with double-word family names on 
    the first page (A. Foo Bar) with (familyname, given-name) ordering (Foo Bar 
    Any) in the Authors' Addresses section.  Regression tested against 200+ 
    known good author extraction results.  A number of stronger restrictions in 
    regular expressions had to be introduced to avoid regression, which is 
    probably all to the good.

  * Added support for ISO-format dates (or RFC 3339 dates, if you will) to 
    the date parsing done for the submission tool.  Also refined the regexes a 
    bit to avoid false matches on for instance things like 'Juniper 2014'.

  * Merged in [8498] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Reworked the logic flow for editing shepherds. Added a message to inform the
    user when the shepherd is not changed. Fixes bug #1508.

    Related to bug #1430. 

  * Added wgchairs@ietf.org to the release notification email.  Split the 
    notification email sending into two, in order to limit the number of 
    addressees for emails going to Mailman lists.

  * Fixed a 500 error that could occur if someone manually entered a
    proceedings url so as to to upload materials to a nonexistent
    meeting/group combination.

  * Prevented 500 errors caused by a file move race condition on draft
    submission confirmation.

  **Enhanced Person-Chooser Widget**

  This release merges in work from olau@iola.dk which enhances a number of
  pages in the datatracker where forms contain fields where a person should be
  chosen, such as for instance when choosing the shepherd of a document, so
  that they uniformly display choices which show both email address and name.

  Furthermore, changes have been made so as to make the email address
  uniformly act as reference to the person record.  

  Autocompletion is now consistently provided when looking for the email
  address or name of the person to choose.  

  This solves a number of issues where it has been difficult to choose the
  correct Person/Email combination, and where the correct email address to use
  for an association has been unavailable previously.

ietfdb (5.6.5) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is a minor release which brings in support for 'recording' documents,
  intended to cover audio and video recordings.  This makes it possible to
  associate links to audio and video recordings with meeting sessions, and
  will make it possible to also include such links in the proceedings.  There
  is also a database schema migration needed to support the 'recording'
  documents.

  * Merged in [8237] from rcross@amsl.com:
    Changes to support video content in proceedings ('recording' document 
    type).

  * Normalized the naming of a couple of NameModel subclasses, with a migration
    and updated fixture.

  * Added a migration to change foreign keys to NameModel models from 8 to 
    32 bytes.

    Removes a modify-while-iterating error, and removes a bug where two
    different bits of code thought they were responsible for deleting things
    from a global list.  Fixes bug #1498.  

  * Merged in [8301] from rcross@amsl.com:
    Changes to support consensus status.   

  * Merged in [8293] from rjsparks@nostrum.com (Note: Should what is now
    captured in the STATUSCHANGE_RELATIONS list instead be captured in the
    database in name_docrelationshipname? ):

    - Changed the default notification list to include .all for documents, and
      the wg list for wg documents.
    - Allowed recalculating the notification list for all document types.
    - Improved the calculated notification list value for charters, 
      conflict-reviews, and status-changes.

  * Merged in [8271] and [8292] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Send email when a the telechat date (or returning item bit) changes for a
    document.  Fixes #1452 

  * Merged in [8262] and [8263] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:

    - Changes when returning_item is automatically set to match the current
      IESGs preferences.  Removes several chunks of dead code related to editing
      telechat dates.  Improves returning item tests.
    - Refactored multiple edit_telechat functions into one function in
      doc_views.  Added a helper function for determining if ballots have
      changed to isolate the implementation.  Fixed the issue with
      update_agenda setting the returning item bit even when the user
      explicitly said not to.  Added prompting to encourage proper setting
      of the returning item bit to the edit_telechat view.

    Fixes #1209

      extending them to demonstrate current reported bugs.
    - Made doc.active_defer_event() look for the events that are currently being
      created. This remains brittle.

  **Team Pages**

  This release adds group page support also for non-WG/RG groups, extending
  and generalising the work done recently to add RG pages.  In particular,
  this provides the Edu team with a place to upload and display educational
  materials.

  Changelog:

  * Merged in branch/iola/team-support from olau@iola.dk.  This generalises 
    and extends the group support for WGs and RGs so that also other groups, 
    such as for instance the Edu Team, can have pages.

  * Miscellaneous other minor changes mostly related to merging, testing and admin.

ietfdb (5.5.2) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is a bugfix release which updates the database contents with bindings for
  breaks and registration timeslots that make the agenda pages come out as
  intended.

  Changelog:

  * Modified the code which adds non-session entries to a schedule so as to 
    bind a Session object also to Break and Registration timeslots, through the 
    Schedule/Timeslot/Session m2m table.  This makes the agenda templates work 
    as expected.  There's also a migration and a standalone script that fills 
    in this information for existing schedules.

  * Tweaked the test-crawler to show the complete chain of referrers for a 
    failing URL.

  * Don't show dash after timeslot names in the ietf agenda if there's no 
    associated location.

ietfdb (5.5.1) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is a routine bugfix release.  Here is a list of the addressed issues:

  * Merged in [7935] from liudapeng@chinamobile.com:
    Added display of both WG conflict and person requirements to the
    session request page. Fixes issue #1384. 

  * Merged in [7924] from rcross@amsl.com:
    Now permitting IPR updates to not specify an IPR license selection.

  * Merged in [7911] from rcross@amsl.com:
    Fixed a problem which occurs when non-ascii names are used
    in session request notification emails.

  * Merged in [7910] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Now paying attention to group type in all the wginfo functions.
    Fixes bug #1423.

  * Merged in [7888] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Fixed a bug where links in personal document tracking list associated with
    groups which are not WGs or RGs return 500, by only turning WG and RG
    groups into links. Fixes bug #1421.

  * Merged in [7865] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Addressed an issue with dragging and dropping unscheduled items back into
    the unscheduled bin (primary fix provided by Matt Miller). Fixes bug #1386.

  * Merged in [7843] from rcross@amsl.com:
    Changed the default group type field on the groups search form, from WG to
    unset.  

  * Changed the code to move drafts from the active draft repository to the 
    draft archive so that all associated files will be moved, not just those 
    with specifically listed extensions.  This fixes the problem that .xml 
    files associated with submitted drafts were moved to the unknown_ids 
    subdirectory of the archive, instead of into the archive proper.

  * Merged in [7879] and [7880] from olau@iola.dk to fix a couple of issues 
    with the 5.5.0 release.

  * Fixed a bug in the mkrelease script, introduced by changing the naming 
    convention for development tags from X.Y.Z-dev to X.Y.Z-dev0 (etc.).

  **Research Group Pages**

  This is a feature release, which introduces pages and workflow support for
  IRTF RGs, similar to what is available for IETF WGs.  You'll find the rg pages
  under /rg/, for instance https://datatracker.ietf.org/rg/cfrg .  Having this
  new baseline in place, I'm sure we'll get requests for refinements, but
  this should be a reasonable first pass at providing this functionality.

ietfdb (5.4.3) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Merged in [7772] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Checks that an email address will survive encoding as part of
    validating a liaison form. Fixes bug 1410.  

  * Merged in [7766] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Improves the robustness of the SMTP error handling utilities. Fixes bug 
    #1409.

    release tag, to make it easier to create personal development branches with 
    development settings.

  * Merged [7748] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Adjust when publication request button appears for documents in
    non-ietf streams. Fixes bug #1402.  

  * Merged [7740] from rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Fixed a crash when requesting sessions for groups that do not have
    ADs. Applied to production as 2014-05-13-sreq-rg.patch .  

  * Merged [7735] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:

    code to work. Fixes bug #1303.  

  * Merged [7734] from rcross@amsl.com: 
    Changes to support IAB group types, including requesting a session
    and uploading materials.  

  * Merged in [7732] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Extended ScheduledSession objects were not initialized correctly, so 
    un-extending did not work. Fixes bug #1401.  

  * Added a file used by bin/mergeready to mark certain releases which has 
    earlier been marked as ready to merge with a 'hold' indication, instead.

  * Replaced a symlink with the real file -- symlink committed by mistake.

  * Added validation of successful draft title extraction on draft 
    submission upload, to avoid a later exception when trying to store draft 
    information for a draft with a null title.

  * Merged in [7726] from rcross@amsl.com:
    Fix secauth middleware to grant access to WG Secretary, RG Chair and 
    Area Director.   

  * Merged [7705] from rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Corrected Document vs DocHistory mismatch when working with
    status-change documents. Corrected creation of BallotDocEvent
    timestamps. Fixes bug #1396.  

  * Merged [7678] from rcross@amsl.com: 
    Show correct group type and ommit link to tools.ietf.org on BOF
    proceedings.  

  * Merged [7677] from rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Protect against cases where add_state_change_event can return
    None. Fixes bug # 1383.

ietfdb (5.4.2) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Merged [7673] from rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Made several changes to better handle non-ascii UTF-8 in email messages.

      - Used multipart mime when including the original message in an error
        message to the secretariat.  Modified the way IANA review email is parsed.
	Added non-ascii UTF-8 tests to the IANA review email parser and to the
	SMTP Exception handling code. 

      - Changed how edit_mtg() is called, in order to propagate kwargs as kwargs.
	Removed repeated @check_permissions.

  * Merged [7653] from rcross@amsl.com: 
    Fixed two issues with proceedings generation.  

  * Merged in [7644] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:

      From rjsparks@nostrum.com:
      - Fixed layout issue on schedule editing page in Chrome

      - Fixed errant display of text in unscheduled group bar
        on the schedule editing page

      - Changed the instruction text on the special requests
	field of the session request form

      From rcross@amsl.com:
      - Improved scheduling of non-session items
      - Fixed issue with layout of the new notifications page
      - Fixed crash on notifications page

ietfdb (5.4.1) ietf; urgency=high

  This is a minor bugfix release, to fix an issue with the mail handling
  infrastructure where one bad email recipient address for a notification
  message (about for instance a state change) could cause some actions related
  to the state change to be skipped:

  * Merged in [7635] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Replumbed how SMTP Exceptions are handled, which involved refactoring
    several mail functions.

  * Also fixed a bug in the agenda editing code caused by a change of an
    attribute name in the python code but not doing the same change in
    templates using the attribute.

  * Changed the logic for what is the 'current' ietf meeting to disregard 
    whether there's an agenda for the meeting or not.  This lets people see the 
    correct session request page for the current meeting.  However, it also 
    makes the /meeting/agenda.html page fail because there's no schedule 
    associated with the meeting; so alternative pages saying 'No agenda 
    available' has been added, too.

  * We're now showing the login link with a http:// scheme instead of 
    https:// when in debug mode, in order to be able to log in when using 
    'python manage.py runserver', which only supports http.

ietfdb (5.4.0) ietf; urgency=medium

  **Enhanced Agenda Scheduling**

  This is a feature release which brings in an updated version of the agenda
  scheduling code.  There are still known bugs and rough edges, but this
  version has many bugfixes and cleaned up issues, and brings essential
  imporvements to the agenda scheduling tool.

  * Merged in [7561] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:

    Updates and bugfixes to the agenda editing features
      - Removes the pattern of using ScheduledSession m2m objects with one of
        the relationships left as None
      - Improves scheduled session state handling
      - Simplifies sending email to scheduled session requestors
      - Improved timeslot purpose and room editing
      - Improved access controls to editing forms
      - Better test coverage for the meeting views
      - Improvements to the javascript driven by prototyping automated tests
      - Better initialization of a new meeting

    On the session request form:
      - Allows specifiying room resources (projectors, meetecho)
      - Allows specifying what people must be present

    On the schedule editing page:
      - correctly calculates conflict levels
      - displays conflicts in and out of each session separately
      - italicizes BoFs
      - shows resource and people conflicts

    Adds automated placement as a management command

ietfdb (5.3.1) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is a minor release, with a number of bug-fixes and a few enhancements.
  Notable enhancements are the ability to set the document consens field back
  to Unknown after it has been set to Yes or No, and an enhancement to the
  test infrastructure that lets tests of email handling interact with a
  real recipient SMTP server, instead of ending in a stub.

  Details:

  * Merged in [7591] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Added a real (if simple) SMTP server to the test framework and tests 
    handling of exceptions and rejected addresses. Fixes ticket #1314.  

  * Merged [7590] from rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Changed when the consensus field is displayed and who can edit it for IETF
    stream documents. Fixes bug #1380.  

  * Merged [7589] from rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Functional changes allowing consensus to be set back to Unknown. Fixes
    ticket #1150.  

  * Merged [7588] from rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Schema migration to allow consensus to be set back to unknown. Related to
    ticket #1150.  

  * Merged in [7587] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Anyone with a role in a group could preapprove drafts. Changed that to 
    an explicit subset of roles. Fixes ticket 998.  

  * Merged in [7586] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Fixed calculation of needed ballots for status-change documents. Added 
    needed ballots tests for drafts and status-change docs. Fixes bug 1116.  

  * When we deployed the rewritten public datatracker, we went from django
    auth to basic http auth.  At that time we also changed the session timeout
    time to 12 hours, from the default 2 weeks.  I see no need to use a
    non-default setting now that we're back to using django auth; changing the
    session timeout time back to 2 weeks.

  * Merged in [7519] from olau@iola.dk:
    Removed uses of gzip middleware - the decorator thing breaks the ETags 
    for some reason, as noted in issue #518, and it seems consensus is that we 
    should do this in Apache instead for the whole site 

  * Merged [7421] from olau@iola.dk: 
    Fixed a crash bug in the redirection logic that occurs when someone posts
    a draft without an access token from the email confirmation step 

  * Merged [7416] from olau@iola.dk: 
    Redo the quickfix to the "Send and Post" button bug (mentioned in issue
    #1308) so that we still do the validation correctly, but just always show
    the button (even if it's unusable)

ietfdb (5.3.0) ietf; urgency=medium

  **Django Authentication replaces Basic HTTP Auth**

  This release changes user authentication for the datatracker from basic http
  auth to Django's built-in authentication.  This has the advantage of making it
  possible to log out, and log in as a different user, which can be useful,
  and it also changes the password hash storage for each user to a much stronger
  hash scheme, upon his or her first successful login after the deployment.

  The email-verification roundtrip which is required to create a new login, or
  change the password of an existing login, is retained.

  For the large majority of users, who either didn't have a password hash in
  the database before the transition to the Python/Django based database
  frontend on 16 July 2010, or had a password hash in the database, but have
  updated their password after 3 July 2012, there should be no impact.
  Password hashes have been imported as needed from the http auth password
  hash file.  The few who had a password hash in the system before 16 July
  2010, and haven't updated their password since 3 July 2012 are encouraged to
  set a new password using the password reset form at
  https://datatracker.ietf.org/accounts/reset/ .  
  If there are issues which prevent a password reset, please email
  henrik@tools.ietf.org for assistance.

ietfdb (5.2.1) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is a minor release, with some bugfixes and some enhancements.  It also
  contains some reworked secretariat code, which changes part of the authentication
  handling in preparation for the next release (5.3.0), which will transition
  the datatracker from using HTTP basic authentication, to Django's built-in
  authentication scheme.

  * Merged in [7568] from rcross@amsl.com: 
    Grant ISOC CEO access to announcement tool, change announcement tool from
    option 'IAB Executive Director' to 'IAB Executive Administrative Manager' 

  * Merged in [7557] from rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Update reference relationships (asyncronously) for new rfcs found when
    syncing with the rfc index. Fixes ticket #1347.  

  * Added some datatracker development notes from the testing extension
    (pyflakes etc.) work

  * Merged in [ 7454] and [7549] from rcross@amsl.com:
    Changes to the secretariat code, to support Django authentication instead
    of basic http auth, and fixes to the tests to work with the secauth
    middleware changes.

  * Pyflakes cleanup to be compliant with pyflakes 0.8.1, which seems to find
    things 0.8.0 didn't find.

  * Changed URLs with explicit scheme from http to https.  Emails that are
    sent out from the datatracker will now specify URLs with https:, rather
    than http.

  * Added a fix to exclude empty email addresses from the send list.

  * The ietf/patches directory doesn't work out as intended, and causes 
    some confusion with the /a/www/ietf-datatracker/patches/ directory on the 
    production server.

  * Backfilled the changelog file, back to 2.00

  * Merged in [7153] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:

    Fixed a typo in code that looks for the IRTF chair email address while 
    adding replaces relationships.
    Made that code slightly more robust.
    Fixes ticket #1253

ietfdb (5.2.0) ietf; urgency=low

  **PyFlakes**

  This is a code cleanup release.  It adds a test and a managemement command
  to run pyflakes (pyflakes is a bit like 'lint' for Python) over the
  datatracker code, and provides cleaned-up code so that the new pyflakes test
  is clean.  The number of lines changed is large, but the changes to what the
  code actually does is limited to fixing bugs discovered by pyflakes during
  the cleanup.  There were around 10 such cases.

  Most of the changes are related to import statements, as the code otherwise
  was pretty clean already.  In almost all places, bulk imports using '*' has been
  replaced by explicit imports, for these reasons:

    * It makes it clear from where an imported name has come, so that a
      human reader can look for an identifier in the import statements, and
      see from where it comes, and where he should go to inspect the related
      code.

    * It makes it clear to the interpreter exactly which symbol is intended,
      in cases where the same symbol is defined in multiple modules imported
      using '*' import.  This is not a common case, but it actually turned up
      a couple of times during the cleanup.  If the '*' imports in question
      hadn't been turned into explicit imports, only the (somewhat arbitrary)
      order of the import statements would have determine which instance of a
      function or class would actually be visible to the following code.  This
      situation can make the code do something different from what was intended,
      in a quite devious way.

    * It avoids unintended import of generically named variables from other
      modules.  Altough having such variables as module globals is a bad
      practice, it happens, and sometimes unintentionally importing them
      through a '*' import will make it appear to the interpreter that a
      statement intended to use an (by mistake undefined) identically named
      local variable is in fact a valid statement which uses the imported
      symbol instead.  Without the '*' import, the situation would be
      correctly flagged by the interpreter.

    * Finally, importing all symbols explicitly makes it possible for pyflakes
      to do a better job in identifying unused and undefined symbols -- in the
      presence of '*' imports, this capability becomes much more limited.
      Several cases of bad code (use of undefined variables) was discovered
      during the cleanup only after the '*' imports were replaced by explicit
      imports.

  In many places, the import statements have been reordered to consistently
  list the generic python library imports first, followed by django imports,
  then local module imports (these typically live on the same level as ietf/
  and django/), finally followed by datatracker-specific imports.  Some people
  find that this kind of consistency in importing, both in keeping a consistent
  order, and in importing in a sequence from the more general down to the more
  specific, aids in the readability of the code.

ietfdb (5.0.1) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is a bugfix release which collects a series of fixes and usability
  tweaks from the last months.

  * Merged [7236] from rcross@amsl.com: 
    Fixed Liaison Add CSRF token error and missing Post and Send button.
    Fixes ticket #1308.

  * Added a way to control the output of the url and template coverage tests,
    so they only will be run for verbosity greater than 1, which is controlled
    by the --verbosity switch.

  * Merged [7214] from rcross@amsl.com: 
    Changeed old references to pub.ietf.org, to datatracker.ietf.org/secr/.    

  * Merged [7213] from rcross@amsl.com: 
    Added a missing template for the secretariat apps: unauthorized.html.   

  * Merged [7209] from rcross@amsl.com: 
    Fixed a typo in secretariat drafts add().   

  * Fixed a probem with wrong URLs in atom feeds, caused by caching.  Fixes 
    issue #1307.

  * Added a blank line before new session group in the text agenda, for
    readability.

  * Added a secret key to settings.py for development use.  NOT for 
    production use; that needs to go in settings_local.py

  * Added a warning to the draft submission page about upcoming submission 
    cut-offs.  Added a value in settings.py for the number of days before the 
    first cut-off to display the waring.

  * Updated the caching settings to use memcached in production.

  * Remove spurious 'yes' in meeting requests page.

  * Merged [7215] from rjsparks@nostrum.com: Use idnits on www.ietf.org
    Fixes ticket #1200 

  * Merged [7215] from rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Use idnits on www.ietf.org.  Fixes ticket #1200 

  * Merged [7212] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Removed the "Reason for (re)chartering" line from the charter main
    document page.  Fixes bug #1294 

  * Merged [7210] from rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Allow the IRTF Chair and the ISE to request a conflict review directly
    through the tracker.  Notify the Secretariat when someone other than the
    secretariat initiates a conflict review.  Notify IANA when anyone
    initiates a conflict review.  Fixes tickets #1287 and #1289 

  * Merged [7204] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Adds the IAB-parented sessions to the set of things returned as "areas"
    Fixes bug #1288 

  * Merged [7077] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Returns "there are no ballots to view yet" rather than 404ing when the
    ballot link is followed for a document that exists.  It is typical for
    last call to be issued (which includes a link to the ballot page) well in
    advance of creating any ballot for a document.  Fixes bug 1233 

  * Merged [7076] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Sets the State(type=draft) to Replaced when a document is replaced using
    views_draft.replaces.  Sets the state back to Active or Expired when a
    document is no longer replaced by another document.  Adds tests for the
    above functionality.  Provides a patch to repair the state of documents
    pointed to by RelatedDocument(relationship__slug='replaces') objects
    created by views_draft.replaces before this fix.  Fixes bug 1234 

  * Merged [6361] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Allow the secretariat and ads to change the title of a status change
    document.  Fixes bug 1141.
    Applied changes to adapt the code from Django 1.2 to 1.6: Provide a
    quoted string to {% url %} and use request.user.person instead of
    request.user.get_profile().

  * Fixed problem with nomcom RST templates not being rendered under Django 
    1.6.

  * Merged [6359] from rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Send email to the secretariat when a status change document is put
    directly into the last-call-requested state.  Fixes bug 1139.

  * Added stream change and state change emails in adopt_draft() -- 
    otherwise we wouldn't have the state change emails assumed in the previous 
    commit.  See issue #1246.

  * Removed the extra (misleading) email about WG adoption which is sent 
    out in addition to the state change emails when a call for addoption (WG) 
    or adoption (RG) is done using the 'Adopt Draft in Group' form.  The state 
    change messages should be sufficient, and are not misleading.  Fixes issue 
    #1246 (and 1290).

  * Handled the case in is_downref() where the src file doesn't have a 
    std_level or intended_std_level set.

  * Modified ALLOWED_HOSTS to permit some (surprising) alternative 
    HTTP_HOST names.  Are these a result of queries proxied through other 
    ietf.org domains?  The numerical address is the mail server address.  We 
    should find out why that appears, and see if it can be made to appear as 
    mail.ietf.org instead.

  * Added Matt Larson to the release notification email address list.

ietfdb (5.0.0) ietf; urgency=medium

  **Database Schema Conversion Complete**

  With this release, a journey which started in 2008 with a *major* redesign
  of the IETF database schema has reached its goal.  We've now converted the
  datatracker completely to the schema designed then, swapping out all the
  models that were changed, converted the database, swapped out all the GUI
  code that was built against the old models, and polished off a host of minor
  issues arising from the conversion.  All this while completing and
  integrating 10 major functionality enhancement projects and releasing more
  than 50 minor releases, with not a single day of downtime.  A history of
  release notes is available here: https://datatracker.ietf.org/release/

  In addition to bringing in the last scheduled polish of the conversion,
  this release also brings in an upgrade of the Django framework from version
  1.2 to 1.6, which gives us a number of new tools and possibilities for
  future work.
  
  A particular mention goes to Ole Laursen <olau@iola.dk>, an outstanding
  programmer at the small Danish firm IOLA, who has been doing a lot of the
  heavy lifting in coding the shim-layer which made it possible to change the
  database schema without a total re-write in the spring of 2012, followed by
  the major code re-write which has taken place since then to get rid of all
  the parts which were written to the old database schema.

  Thanks also goes to all the IETF code sprint participants who have
  contributed, and to Robert Sparks in particular who has contributed *a lot*
  to make it all come together.

  There are still some parts of the schema that need an overhaul, and plans
  exist for addressing those, but overall we should be in good shape for the
  near future, with some room to grow :-)

  **Shim Layer Removal**

  This release removes almost all parts of the shim-layer code which was
  used to provide a semblance of the old database schema to user-interface
  code after we moved to a new database schema in the early part of 2012.

  There should be no changes in basic functionality changes in this release,
  even if there are many small optimisations and changes in code details
  which come in as a result of the shim-layer removal.

ietfdb (4.84) ietf; urgency=low

  This is a minor bugfix release, in preparation for merging in the latest
  shim-removal work.

  * Merged [6859] from rcross@amsl.com: 
    Fixed calls to reverse() to match new url names since code merge

  * Merged [6858] from rcross@amsl.com: 
    Use correct URL in new IPR notification email 

  * Merged [6857] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:  
    A script to run from cron to send daily messages to IETF Announce showing
    the email header field change.  his should be run from Jan 6 to Jan 20,
    after which point we need to deploy analagous changes to the code that
    constructs last call announcements. This is related to bug #811.

  * Merged [6701] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:  
    Adds pages to show what a given document refers to and what refers to it.
    Fixes bug #1194.

  * Merged [6672] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:  
    Removed requirement to enter a phone number in various places on an IPR
    disclosure entry form.  Fixes bug #1176 

  * Fixed a typo.  Fixes issue #1216.

  **IETF 88 Code Sprint**

  This release provides the code from the IETF-88 code sprint, and also
  a number of fixes to things reported during the IETF.

  The number of enhancements coming out of the sprint this time is impressive;
  this may actually have been the most successful sprint till now.

  Of particular note is the new ability for chairs and others who has the
  permission to edit a document's state, to edit replaced-by information for
  documents; and the introduction of information about which documents a given
  document references, for all documents.  Future enhancements will display
  this information as diagrams and textually, and use it to re-introduce the
  dependency diagrams originally provide by Bill Fenner in his stand-alone
  dependency graph application.

  From rcross@amsl.com: 

  * Changed draft replaces action: move document to archive directory 

  From tterriberry@mozilla.com: 

  * Allow wgchairs to edit document replacement relationships.
    This actually allows anyone with can_edit_stream_info permission
    to edit the list. This does draft name completion, but does not
    currently filter those names for likely replacements. Styling is
    also basically non-existent.  Fixes #1002 

  * Added 'Track this document' link on drafts.  Fixes #1085. 

  * Mark concluded BoFs as BoFs, not Concluded WGs.  Fixes #1169. 

  From bartosz.balazinski@interdigital.com:

  * Added the new version of the shepherd writeup as a comment when it's edited.
    The new version works like this:

     -  Any shepherd writeups done before the document is submitted for
	publication are not disclosed in the history.

     -  When the document is submitted for publication the available writeup (if
	available) is added to history.

     -  Any further writeups after the document has been submitted for publication
	are disclosed in the history. 

  From suresh.krishnan@ericsson.com:

  * Refactored the mails sent when state is changed along with annotation tags.
    Don't send emails for only comment changes, just add a history entry.  For
    state changes and annotation changes, only send one email, containing
    information about both state changes and annotation tag changes.  
    Fixes issue #1127.

  From jmh@joelhalpern.com:

  * Included confirmation addresses in ID-Submission success notice.
    Fixes issue #1097. 

  * Added document titles to status change request email.  Fixes issue #1069. 

  * Added \'Last Call Issued:\' to front of last call atom feed entry subjects. 

  * Fixed conflict review text for irtf docs to reference RFC 5743. 

  * Added the last call expiration date to the document header, and remove
    duplicate code for producing the iest state summary. 

  From markus.stenberg@iki.fi: 

  * Added .csv export from private community lists.  Fixes #1074

  * Took care of #841 by moving <span> correctly outside <a> altogether.

  From adam@nostrum.com: 

  * Fixed #1153: Fixes IPR disclosures being counted multiple times and
    counting of \'not yet approved\' IPR disclosures. 

  From rjsparks@nostrum.com: 

    Refined Bill Fenner's regex based search through documents for references.
    This populates RelatedDocument with relations for references for each type
    draft Document; replaces these reference relationships with updated
    copies upon draft submission.  Note to deployer: There is a script to run in
    patches/fill_in_references.py that does the work of bringing the database
    up to date. It takes around 10 minutes to complete on a fast development
    laptop.  Fixes bug #1173 

  Other changes:

  * Tweaked the style used on the nomcom feedback pages a bit, to give people
    a bit more room to write in the feedback field.

  * It turns out that the get_user_email is called for every nominee listed on
    a feedback page, which is insane.  But until the template can be rewritten
    to do this in a more sane way, we cache the lookup result.

  * Changed things so the left-side navbar doesn't jump to full page width in
    the instant before the main content is loaded.  NB: Cleanup action needed:
    replace all px dimensions with em, consistently.

  * Included the IAOC update session in the training section of the agenda.

  * By preference, show the same email for a logged-in user as his login, if
    it exists; otherwise show the newest active email address.

  * Many minor fixes to agenda templates and the known-good agenda test files.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  06 Nov 2013 20:33:43 +0100

ietfdb (4.82) ietf; urgency=high

  * Removed the ams_filters template tag file from the meeting app -- it 
    was a copy of the ams_filters under secr/, and masked it.

  * Added another state to the possible IETFWG states in the group proxy 
    models file, to avoid exceptions.

  * Changed the 'pipe' utility to work with commands taking input
    on standard in, also when providing an emtpy string as input.
    This is now different from providing 'None' as the input
    argument, or omitting it.

  * Tweaked the utility script to find missing submission confirmation 
    emails.

  * Rewrote html and text agenda templates to take schedule as data.

  * Added the utility program (vzic) used to generate timezone-specific iCalendar 
    information, and the original .ics files generated by the utility program 
    in 2010.

  * Added some code to vzic to make it output symlinks for all timezone 
    links specified in the Olson database, not only some of them.

  * Included newly generated .ics files, from
    http://www.iana.org/time-zones/repository/releases/tzdata2013h.tar.gz.
    This updates the .ics files to use timezone information current as of 27
    Oct 2013.

  * Added links to the individual nominee fedback pages to the
    private nomcom index page, in order to make it easier to find
    and look at the feedback for a filtered set of nominees.

  * Added a template filter to do required escaping in iCalendar pages.

  * Changed the path to iCalendar vtimezone information to point into the
    release directory, so that we can make updated vtimezone information
    available directly in a release, instead of out-of-band.

  * Provided new methods Meeting.vtimezone() which return a vtimezone stanza
    for ical files, based on the timezone setting for a meeting, fetched from
    a pre- generated file; and Session.ical_status(), which provides a string
    appropriate for use in ical STATUS: entries.

  * New view code and templates for agenda pages, updating all agenda
    templates to take schedule-specific information so that they will work
    with arbitrary schedules, not just the official schedule for a meeting.

  * Updated test masters to match the changed (and now more predictable) order
    of some entries in the agenda pages.

  * Merged [6486] from rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Slightly more than minimal changes to have questionnaire reminders go 
    only to those nominees who have accepted but have not yet sent in a 
    questionnaire for a given position 

  * Marked some instances of code in the meetings app which used variables
    that don't exist with XXX Fixme.  Removed dependency on the logging
    module, we use syslog by default.  Replaced some log.debug() calls with
    debug.log().

  * Removed a lot of dead code and unused imports.

  * Merged [6580] from rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Reverted materials.html and the view that drives it to before the 4.70 
    merge.
    Tweaked the view to get (I hope) the right things. 

  * Updated the template and support functions for iPhone agenda page.

ietfdb (4.81) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Merged in branch/amsl/1.50@6388 from rcross@amsl.com, with secretariat
    tool announcement fixes, permission fixes, and agenda database schema
    fixes.

  * Required logins to be all-lowercase.  This was prompted by repeated
    trouble with people registering non-lowercase logins, then trying to log
    in with all-lowercase, or vice versa.

  * Merged [6465] and [6466] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:

    Added the ability to send reminders to complete questionnaires to nominees
    in the accepted state.  Changed the send_reminders management command to
    not take any arguments and run against all active nomcoms.  Removed bugs
    from the send_reminders management command and added tests for it.
    Adjusted several dbtemplate titles and content.  Fixes bug 1157

  * Merged [6468] and [6469] from ejimenez@yaco.es:

    Now a Nomcom incumbent can be set to None for positions. Fixes #1156.

  * Let Timeslot.session() Return the first session, rather than none, for
    timeslots with multiple associated sessions for the public schedule.

  * Made the timeslots sent to the agenda.ics and agenda.txt template
    distinct, to avoid duplicate agenda items.  Fixes issue #1155.

  * Added caching for the somewhat costly TimeSlot.session() method/property.
    This speeds up text agenda generation using the legacy template
    substantially.

  * Tweaked the strings displayed when a plenary agenda cannot be shown.

  * Changed the select statement in MeetingProxy.sessions() to produce correct
    results for the official agenda, and filter out timeslot entries without
    scheduled sessions.

  * Remove the AD information from the text agenda until we fix the database
    so that it displays consistently correctly for past meetings.

  * Reverted to release 4.72 versions of several functions and methods,
    starting with agenda_info() and the view functions that use it.  Also
    changed meeting/tests/agenda.py to accept matching return values.
    Reverted old supporting models and proxy models to 4.72 versions, too, in
    meeting/proxy.py and proceedings/models.py.  Updated the proxy models
    which rely on TimeSlot to work properly with the m2m sessions field, and
    adjusted some other functions, such as session_agenda() to also understand
    the m2m sessions field (and its reverse).  Added an understanding of the
    "bof-conc" state to the code which returns 'BOF' or 'WG' for agenda
    templates.

  * Reverted to release 4.72 versions of txt, ics, and csv agendas, with minor
    tweaks.

  * Improved the test suite with improved diff tests for retrieved urltest
    files.  A number of other test tweaks and enhancements, including several
    known-good master files to diff generated pages against.

  * Cleanup action: replaced the noTable block construct with start/end
    table_content blocks in order to not have to open and close tables in
    different blocks, and not have empty tables lying about.

  * Reinstated the release 4.72 get_agenda_info() as legacy_get_agenda_info(),
    and tweaked it to work with the new Timeslot model's sessions field.
    Reverted the html agenda view code to use legacy_get_agenda_info(), based
    on the release 4.72 code.  This is a fix to display the html agenda for
    now, and will need more cleanup, but this should be done without
    introducing scheduledsession instances to the template.

  * Added a property method to return what the 'session' field used to return,
    but based on the 'sessions' m2m field filtered with the meeting agenda.
    This is right for the main meeting agenda, but not for personal schedule
    layouts, so this isn't a final fix.

  * Reverted html agenda templates to release 4.72 state, except for a jquery
    version change and moving inline weekview javascript to a separate file.

  * Changed the WG edit form so that once an acronym has been set, the acronym
    field is read-only; also changed the form validation to not permit changes
    to an existing acronym.

  * Changed NOMCOM_FROM_EMAIL to be the Nomcom chair instead of the
    secretariat. Fixes issue #1152.

  * Merged [6413] from rjsparks@nostrum.com: Removed redundant call to
    not_duplicated from the nomcom/private_index template.  It was already
    applied in the view, and interacted badly with the list comprehension
    method of filtering for NomineePositions that had associated questionnaire
    responses.  Fixes bug 1151.

  * Added Ryan to the admin list so he'll get 500 notifications.

  **Agenda Scheduling Tool**

  This is a major release which provides the code drop from phase 3 of the
  Agenda Scheduling Tool.  The code has been merged in, and a lot of minor
  alignments done.  Deployment of this will make the phase 3 agenda editing
  tools available from the main ietf site, will align the database schema with
  that used in the ongoing development work, and will provide the correct
  models for secretariat tool adaptations.

  Other changes:

  * Reworked the TestCase code and fixture loading substantially, resulting
    in a substantial speed increase for tests when run on a transaction-
    capable database engine.

  * Added an index page for nomcoms, at /nomcom/, with links to nomcom 
    pages and announcements, where they exist.

  * Fixed some bugs in the EncryptedTextField class.

  * Fixed the language of the nomination confirmation message.

  * Changed 'requirement' to 'desired expertise' in user-visible places in 
    the nomcom app.

  * Fixed a wrong secretariat template extension name.

  * Provide the missing safe_rep function required in the back-ported 
    assertIsNone() test case method.

  * Added an explanatory paragraph to the Desired Expertise page.

  * The exception string for submission upload read errors seems to have 
    changed after we switched to wsgi, from "Client read error" to "request 
    data read error".  Now looking for just "read error" to catch both.

  * Tweaked the introductory text on the Nomcom Desired Expertise page.

  * Added a makefixture management command, from 
    http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/918/, somewhat hacked.

  * Updated the test fixtures, built to be more internally consistent in order
    to be able to pre-load them for the test suite.

  * Fixed the many times duplicated position names in the position selection 
    drop-down list in the nomcom private index page.  Fixes issue #1137.

ietfdb (4.72) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Added a migration for a new ConstraintName field: penalty

  * Fixed 2 issues with the wg document list: Wrong heading for the related 
    docs, and candidate wg docs listed as wg docs, rather than related docs.

  * Fixed an issue arising when trying to edit a document state when there's
    no prior state, and removed the link to edit the document state when
    there's no set state.

  * Tweaked the template used to generate the various 1wg-charter*.txt 
    files to properly fetch email addresses.

  * Merged in a fix from rjsparks@nostrum.com for incorrect IANA 
    notification email addresses.

  * Added Nomcom role suport to role_required() through has_role().  This will
    let us get rid of the more specialized ad_hoc nomcom_memeber_required()
    function which can't handle access for multiple roles.

  * Replaced the ad_hoc nomcom_member_required() decorator with the generic 
    role_required() decorator.  Changed access permission for nomcom-chair only 
    pages to also permit nomcom advisor access (this lets the previous nomcom 
    chair explain and assist as needed).  Also tweaked some text strings in the 
    email feedback pipe script.

  * Added a WSGI connector for the datatracker, to let us run under mod_wsgi.

  * Modified the code which accumulates ipr disclosures associated with a 
    document, shown as an IPR count in search results.  The previous code had 
    two deficiencies: it could count some IPR disclosures twice, and it also 
    included withdrawn and pending disclosures.  The current count matches the 
    IPR search results better.

  * Moved the nomcom private key storage out of the source tree, which is a 
    silly place to put it.

  * Added a dev-specific robots.txt, which blocks all robots.

  * Merged in the latest secretariat code from rcross@amsl.com, from
    branch/amsl/trunkmerge@6149.

  * Added the ability to search for documents from a certain stream to the
    main document search form.

  * Added overview pages for non-ietf-stream documents (ise, iab, irtf), and
    links to them form the sidebar.

  * Removed the old ad documents page and its view function, and put in a
    redirect from the temporary /ad2/ url to the /ad/ url.  Also replaced the
    two AD document links in the lefthand menubar with one pointing to the new
    view (under the old URL).

ietfdb (4.71) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Merged in personal/rjs/r6117-pubreq@6119:

    - Made Publication Request (for documents from IETF working groups) an
      explicit action rather than a side-effect.

    - Simplified the working group state edit form.

    - Added hints to the WG state edit form to use the document's main page to
      request publication.

    - If a document is moved into IESG processing directly by the secretariat or
      an AD (old processing path), set working group state accordingly.


  * Merged in branch/iola/shimfree@6083.  This cleans up and moves relevant 
    code from idrfc/ to doc/.  There should now only be a bit of old wrapper 
    code left in idrfc; that will go away when the remaining models which use 
    it are cleaned up.

  * Fixed the manage.py command so it adds our own import path to the Python 
    path automatically; people won't have to explicitly add pythonpath any
    more::

      $ PYTHONPATH=$PWD ietf/manage.py ...

  * Applied a patch from rjsparks@nostrum.com to fix a line colouring bug in 
    IPR lists.

  * Fixed a regression: wrong URL to IESG state diagram in state help.  Fixes 
    issue #1119.

  * Merged personal/rjs/v4.70@6042:

    - Made reporting IPR consistant across document searches, IPR 
      searches, AD document queues, last calls, and agendas. All these points now 
      report on the document(s) being directly queried, and the documents those 
      transitively replace or obsolete.

    - Brought search results against WGs and document titles into 
      consistency with results from searching for individual documents

    - Added the IPR count to the link on the documents main page (when 
      not zero)

    - Built on Henrik's reimplementation of all_related\_\*, making the 
      \*_related_\* functions return DocAlias? lists consistently, and added 
      corresponding _relations_ functions to get lists of actual RelatedDocument? 
      objects.

    - Added getting the DocAlias? with the same name to Document

    - Added getting related IPR disclosures (as described in the first 
      bullet) to Document

    - Simplified ipr/related.py

    - Removed the use of DraftLikeDocAlias? and IETFWG from 
      ipr/search.py. Retooled the various search functions and templates to use 
      DocAlias? and IprDocAlias? directly.

    - Removed dead code from ipr/search.py

    - Removed the special handling of WG 2000 from ipr/search.py 

    This fixes bug #1071

  * Fixed a regression in display of IESG state; added back substate 
    information.  Fixes issue #1117.

  * Added template rendering verification on dbtemplate form submission in 
    order to catch errors in edited templates before they are committed.  This 
    should prevent server 500 errors when rendering dbtemplate pages.  Fixes 
    issue #1113.

  * Selectively removed the agenda and minutes warnings from the meeting 
    materials page, for educational sessions where agenda and minutes aren't 
    expected.  Fixes issue #1115.

  * Changed the order of the files diffed in the draft diff links on the 
    history page.  Fixes issue #1114.

  * Added Auto-Submitted and Precedence header fields to outgoing email 
    messages.

  * Fixed a possible KeyError bug for a missing form field 'by'.

  * Added code to expire last calls for statechg documents too (in addition 
    to iesg drafts) with the expire-last-call script.  Fixes issue #1092.

  * Added secretaries to those who are authorized to edit stream info for a 
    document.

  * Added a penalty field to the ConstraintNames, for use in agenda 
    scheduling.

  * Refactored group membership code, adding advisors and liaisons to the 
    membership list.  Needed for the nomcom code.

  * Fixed the broken WG document list template (regression caused by the 
    shimfree merge).

  * Fixed the red-on-red error message style which came in with the nomcom 
    code merge.

  * Fixed the nomcom email pipe command to read from stdin if no file given, 
    and give better error messages.

  * Added migrations which should have been part of release 4.70.

  **NomCom Support**

  This release provides a datatracker nomcom app, ported from the earlier
  standalone nomcom app written by henrik.  It includes public nomcom
  pages which provides an interface for members of the community to
  propose and comment on nominees for the positions the nomcom is filling,
  and private nomcom pages for secure management and browsing of positions,
  nominees, and comments.

  **IETF 87 Code Sprint**

  This release provides the code from the IETF-87 code sprint, and also
  a number of fixes to things reported during the IETF, and some enhancements
  requested.

  Noticeable enhancements are that document search now permits you to search
  for all kind of documents, not only for drafts and RFCs (you can searc for
  charters, slides and whatnot); that Research Group chairs now have the
  ability to manage their documents in the tracker; and that the tracker now
  has the ability to generate WG and draft email aliases, which permits us to
  plan a transition of the email aliases to the main ietf mail server.

  There are however many other much requested fixes and enhancements :-)

  From markus.stenberg@iki.fi:

  * Added support and scripts for generation of wg- and draft-aliases.  
    Fixes issue #713.

  From adam@nostrum.com: 

  * Added the capability to search for all kinds of documents in the main
    datatracker search page.  Fixes bug #838.

  * Added tooltip capability to document tabs, and tooltips for disabled 
    IESG Evaluation/Review tab.  Fixes bug #448.

  * Added a document link to the emails sent on discuss/comment changes.  
    Fixes bug #916 

  From rjsparks@nostrum.com: 

  * Added related documents to the set of documents checked for IPR 
    declarations when building last call text. Partially addresses #1071.

  From suresh.krishnan@ericsson.com: 

  * When working group chairs added an annotation to a document, the date 
    on the history entry was wrong. It has now been fixed. Fixes issue #1046.

  * Fixed the last call processing code to identify the new placeholder 
    writeup. Fixes issue #884.

  Other fixes:

  * Added group secretaries to those authorise to edit group document 
    meta-information.

  * Added RG chairs and secretaries to those authorized to edit group document
    meta-information.

  * Added a landing page for missing associations between login and Person record.

  * Tweaked the charter-and-milestones presentation in order to not blow up on
    bad character encodings in charter file.

  * Added back the 'Request Publication' action (regression loss) on draft 
    pages for the non-ietf streams.

  * Fixed a bug in rendering the AD/Shepherd column in document list pages, 
    when no AD is associated with a document.  Fixes issue #1079.

  * Modified the doc stream-change edit form to reset doc.group to None on 
    stream changes.  Fixes issue #1078.

  * Fixed double plural 's' caused by the use of 'pluralize' in the 
    template *and* plural forms for the group headers returned by 
    fill_in_search_attributes().  Fixes issue #1077.

  * Fixed the incorrect blankline placemnt in the refactored template for 
    id-index and id-abstracts, when generating abstracts.  Fixes issue #1076.

  * Added convenience methods to the Document class to recursively retrieve 
    all forward / reverse relationship of a kind or set of kinds.

  * Fixed the handling of help pages for doc states.

  * Added a direct link to the cookie options in use by the datatracker to 
    the lefthand menubar.  Fixes issue #1075.

  * Fixed a regression: restore diff pane in history page for RFCs.

  * Fixed a regression: display of full draft/rfc text now again obeys the 
    full_draft cookie setting.

  * Changed the mimetype detection code to only read first 4k block of 
    file, not the whole file.

  * Made the code which uses the 'magic' module to determine file type and 
    encoding work with both the old and new interface to python-magic.

  * Added a guard to prevent duplicate RFC-Editor notifications for 
    approved documents, and added logging to the notification routine.

  **Shimfree Document Pages**

  This release provides new shimfree code in /doc/ which replaces code mainly
  from /idrfc/ and /idindex/.  It comprises the first two code drops from the
  shimfree project.  There are also some additional functionality, as detailed
  below.

  * Added an index page at /help/state, listing the document states that
    have help information.

  * On request form the secretariat, added a note to the new I-D announcement
    messages about there being a couple of minutes delay between submission
    and the appearance of htmlized document and diff on the tools servers.

  * Merged in two huge chunks of shim-layer removals from olau@iola.dk,
    comprising:

     - Deleted dead code in many places.

     - Renamed id-something to draft-something, make the "is
       this eligible for expiration" logic clearer

     - Added a name for IPR search URL

     - Revamped the ballot popup view

     - URL reversed the IPR search link instead of hardcoding it

     - Cleaned up search views and remove dead code, port them to the new DB
       schema, hack related views in iesg/ and wginfo/ to use the new search
       interfaces, avoid camelCase in search GET parameters (with
       backwards-compat fallback), add some simple search unit tests, remove
       caching from views_search.py index pages as they're now pretty fast to
       generate, rewrite ballot popup JS, regularize some CSS classes to use
       hyphen-notation rather than camelCase, move some of the search
       templates to doc/.  idrfc/ now mostly contains some wrapper code still
       in use by other subdirs, some ported code not yet moved, and dead code.

     - Fixed output bug in test crawler and print referrer upon errors so it's
       easier to figure out where a link came from

     - Added /doc/in-last-call/ to crawler, report original page as referrer in
       a redirect chain rather than intermediate URL

     - Ported idindex to new schema, speed them up, add tests, refactor index
       page in views_search to share code with the text index file, get rid
       of some special-case idindex filters from ietf_filters, move
       "/drafts/" redirects to a file in /doc/

     - Ported /idtracker/status/ and /idtracker/status/last-call/ overview of
       drafts in IESG process to new schema in /doc/iesg/ and
       /doc/iesg/last-call/

     - Added redirects for all of /idtracker/\*, removed all view code and other
       dead code from idtracker/

     - Removed the idtracker sitemap indexing drafts - in its current form,
       it adds nothing of value to the HTML-based /doc/all/ view, and it's
       pretty slow

     - Ported idtracker feeds to new schema, move them to doc/, cleaned up
       idtracker/ - only templatetags/ietf_filters and proxy code is left

     - Removed .related many to many relationship, it's not really useful
       since we always have to restrict on the relationship type anyway,
       instead add two helpers for doing the necessary queries (in both
       directions)

     - Added migration for transforming the .desc on the new_revision events
       into something more akin to what is actually shown in the history page

     - Added migration for blanking IESG notes that just consist of "RFC
       XXXX", these have been superfluous for some time

     - Grant stream chairs access to changing the stream on a draft

     - Hacked the format_history_text filter to be less weird, using the same
       formatting for snippets and full text, also link up legacy ballot set
       events

     - Moved the decoraters + utilities to new ietfauth/utils.py file

     - Added simple helper to Email to identify invalid email addresses (from
       legacy author entries)

     - Used new new_revision .desc format for when drafts are submitted

     - Improved the looks of the button class by adding extra contrast and a
       linear gradient. Currently the gradient is only visible in fairly
       recent browsers.

     - Rewrote draft and RFC tabs in terms of the new schema, porting
       write-up and history tabs as well

     - Fixed two bugs in RFC Editor syncing: make sure documents we don't know
       beforehand get a "draft" type and make sure individually submitted
       drafts get the type="individ" group instead of NULL

     - Made the CSS-styled button feel a bit nicer to use by flattening the
       active state, also introduce some temporary styles until browsers
       catch up with the standard syntax

     - Added migrations for fixing 1) a dummy RFC entry, 2) three stand-alone
       RFCs that didn't get their doc.type set, 3) a big bunch of historic
       stand-alone RFCs that have doc.group=None - set these to the individual
       submission "none" group for the time being so the view code doesn't
       have to deal with a special case.  In some cases this is wrong since
       there actually was a WG associated but unfortunately fixing them
       properly requires detective work (probably parsing the RFCs) and in at
       least some cases recreating historic WGs. In case someone ends up doing
       this, the documents to check can still be found with
       Document.objects.filter(name__startswith="rfc", group__type="individ")
       since there are almost no new RFCs that didn't went through the I-D
       process.

     - Merged the I-D and RFC views by showing I-D information on RFCs too.
       I-Ds that have been published as RFCs redirect to the RFC URL. Also
       support alias URLs so e.g. /doc/bcpXXXX redirects to /doc/rfcXXXX.

     - Fixed revision augmentation so events after RFC publication gets a "RFC"
       designation

     - Fixed a bug with tabs not using provided name but rather doc.name

     - Displaying draft-iesg state rather than doc.friendly_state as IESG state,
       also show a notice that the IESG state refers to post-RFC processing
       if it does, like the old separate RFC page did

     - Fixed the RFC number doc.note migration to catch combined "RFC XXX; BCP
       XXX" notes too, use the opportunity to remove inserted HTML tags from
       notes and rely on linebreaksbr filter instead (the other thing was a
       left-over from the Perl days), update the various uses of the note to
       reflect that

     - Refactored slightly to make views_doc.py independent of other idrfc code

     - Moveed idrfc/views_doc.py to doc/ with associated templates, replace the
       somewhat fragile simple URL tests for views_doc.py with ordinary unit
       tests. The new tests are still fairly basic but at least test more
       than the URL tests did.

     - Made sure RFC's (and BCP/STD/FYI) are stored as RFC123 instead of
       RFC0123 in the alias table with a new migration and a change to the
       RFC Editor sync, this in turn makes /doc/std1/ do the right thing

     - Now /doc/std1/ works, we can actually do a local link in
       urlize_ietf_docs rather than linking to the tools.ietf.org server

     - Fixed history text formatter: sanitize HTML before adding linebreaks and
       non-breaking spaces, this cuts the time to render a history page with
       long comments in half

     - Added a test crawler that walks through the crawlable part of the site,
       reporting errors and slow pages

     - Got rid of initial "No record" positions when showing old positions,
       it's just noise

     - Added a .select_related() to the document main tab to reduce the number
       of DB queries, unfortunately it seems it doesn't really help with
       Django 1.2.x due to a bug (Document inherits from DocumentInfo which
       makes things a bit more complicated)

     - Introduced a simple cache in doc.get_state so repeated reads don't
       cause a DB query

     - Cleaned up the search code in preparation for removal of the shim-layer;
       use a static button and don't send extraneous GET parameters

  This release provides improvements in the test suite, which nows runs
  cleanly with test database rollbacks (using InnoDB) in less than half he

  Most of the time is now spent on the page load tests, not on fixture
  re-loading.

ietfdb (4.52) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is a minor bugfix release, in preparation for the next major  merge.  

  * Fixed problem with caching of utc agenda -- use a separate cache name for
    this.

  * Permit unicode milestone text (using unicode() instead of str() in
    comparison when looking for milestone changes).  Fixes issue #1065.

  * Added a list of releases below the release notes at /releases/*

  * From RjS: Added a case in the render_ballot_icon() filter for statchg
    documents.

  * Removed duplicate '.errorlist' style.

  * Fixed missing name change when moving settings from rfceditor module to
    settings.py.

  * Merged [5613] from mcr@sandelman.ca: include a way to dump timedeltafields
    so that it is possible to save data to fixtures.

  From olau@iola.dk:

  * Skip IANA - Review Needed and Version Changed - Review Needed changes from
    IANA as it turns out that the Datatracker is the authoritative source on
    these states. Also improve logging so that the raw JSON from IANA is
    dumped, the parsed JSON on imported changes is dumped and we write to
    syslog before starting a sync script in the notification view.

  * Only add charter state change link when chartering, it doesn't make sense
    for an approved charter. Fixes #861.

  * Don't display group.comments on the charter document page. Apparently
    group.comments have been used by the Secretariat in the past for
    chartering comments, but it's not possible to edit the field and the whole
    thing doesn't make sense from a modelling perspective - a feature like
    this should probably use the note field on the charter.  Fixes issue
    #1048.

  * Don't crash if an attachment has been created already, just reuse it -
    this case shouldn't actually happen, but apparently sometimes does,
    probably due to a concurrency issue

  * Add link to charter pages from the milestones editing page (besides the
    cancel button), fixes #1044.

  * Special-case proposed working groups with respect to milestones, they get
    the charter milestones on the WG charter page rather than the current set

  * Show approved milestones on /doc/charter-xyz/ page if the charter is
    approved instead of only showing proposed milestones for proposed charters

  * Use argument 'draft' for document instead of 'approved_draft_name' when 
    sending sync notifications to the RFC-Editor.

  * Moved settings for RFC-Editor sync to settings.py.

  * Don't actually do a post to the rfc-editor's state sync interface for a 
    publication request when not in production mode.

  * Merged [5770] from rjsparks@nostrum.com: 

    - Added editing last call messages, requesting, issuing and tracking IETF 
      LCs to status-change documents

    - Added a Cancel button to the form that allows editing the relations for 
      status-change documents

    - Added instructions to the agenda section 3.3

    This adds states to status-change- documents and has a migration that 
    must be applied.  Fixes bug #1039

  This release contains bugfixes and some minor features.

  * Added IAB Chair permission for some IESG agenda links.

  * Added alternative names for 2 iana states which seems to have changed 
    name since the code was originally deployed.  Also added a guard against 
    sending state change emails when the iana state hasn't actually changed.

  * Don't use non-ascii names in the email lists (at least for now), as the
    the code doesn't generate proper email header IDN encoding for non-ascii
    addresses.

  * Added the secretariat to the recipient list for publication request 
    emails generated by the datatracker.  Fixes issue #964.

  * Fixed a problem with checking shepherd writeup editing permissions for 
    logged-in users with no associated person object.

  * Reverted a change from [5602], reinstating the explicit To: field for
    last-call announcements, because removing it caused the copies of the
    announcements destined for email lists to be held by Mailman for
    moderation because of implicit destination.  Relates to issue #811.

  * Changed additional places to use IANA sync settings from settings.py

  * Merged [5645],[5646] and [5647] from olau@iola.dk:

    - Added support for notifying the RFC Editor upon draft approval

    - Added action to post to RFC Editor on non-IESG publication requests too

    - Fixed a bug that the CC on the announcement copy sent to IANA wasn't
      cleared causing people on the CC to get duplicate emails

  * Refined the INSTALL instructions for secretariat releases.

  * Added instructions on updating the release version and date for patch 
    releases.

  * Added RjS to the ADMINS setting, so he will receive exception emails.

ietfdb (4.44) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is a combined bugfix and feature release.  It provides improvements to
  last-call messages, the display of document shepherd information, the
  content of AD pages, IESG ballot information, and various forms; and it
  fixes a number of bugs.

  From rjsparks@nostrum.com:

  * Merged [5600] and [5602]:  Changed the header to last call messages to IETF
    Announce and to IANA to make replying to the announcement less likely to
    create an unnecessary ticket.

  * Merged [5569] and [5572]: Small fixes in 4.43 and showing the shepherd
    (when there is one) on search results, documents for this ad, and wg
    document lists.  Fixes bug #972.

  * Merged [5570]: Moves the interface to edit shepherds and sheperd writeups
    out of the wgtracker interface and into the doc views (via idrfc).  Added a
    little to the simple authorization code (can_edit) in idrfc.  Added a way
    to reset the writeup to the current templates (leaving extension points to
    take templates for non-ietf stream documents).  Fixes bug #967. (This also
    fixes tickets #834 and #691 (which were effectively duplicates of #967)

  * Merged [5595]: Tweaked the grouping code to not break documents of the
    same type up 

  * Merged [5476]:

    - Added a document type for changing the publication status of other 
      documents, and the UI for manipulating them.

    - Added charters, conflict reviews, and status changes to the AD's \'My 
      Documents\' page

    - Improved the presentation of all document types on the Agenda, Future 
      Telechats, Scribe and Moderator package pages

    - Made the reverse name for document relationships explicit rather than 
      deriving them from forward names

    - Added a way to get to the underlying Document (when it exists) from 
      an RfcWrapper

    - Unified several common forms used by different document types 

  From henrik@levkowetz.com:

  * Changed which email addresses the submission tool uses for confirmation 
    emails and sending out full submission status URLs from the emails found in 
    the submitted document (which could be empty, broken, or intentionally 
    different than the original authors) to the author emails from the previous 
    version, where a previous version exists.  This fixes breakage which can 
    occur when no valid email addresses can be found in a broken submission, 
    and also ensures that at least one of the authors of a previous version 
    signs off on a new version, preventing submission hijacking.

  * Added a section to the meeting materials page for IAB sessions. Added a 
    link bar at the top to make it easier to find sections like Training and 
    IAB.

  * Don't list documents replaced by other documents in the IESG Status 
    list at /idtracker/status/.

  * Fixed a bug which would set the state in the event accompanying a WG 
    activation to 'Proposed', which messes up various views.

  * Add new tag 'rev-wg' to the list of valid annotation tags for the ietf 
    stream.  Note: This list and those on nearby lines needs to be refactored 
    into a table, instead of sitting in the code.

  * Added instructions on how to patch the production code (if necessary) 
    to the INSTALL description.

  * Fixed rounding issue in IESG positions neded calculation.  Fixes issue 
    #974.

  * Made agenda views with timezone information work also for earlier
    meetings (those without timezone data available).

    states

  * Added new rules to the atom tracker for picking up RFCs

  * Changed the header fields on the RFC table so that they reflect RFC 
    descriptions rather than I-D descriptions. 

  * Increased the set of information being returned on the atom viewer to 
    reflect IETF specific information. 

  From housley@vigilsec.com: 

  * Send email to statements@ietf.org when a pending liaison statement gets 
    queued. 

  From jmh@joelhalpern.com:

  From adam@nostrum.com:

  * Fixed formatting for history page.  Relates to issue #210.

  * Added links to the session request page

  * Two changes: (1) searches by substring rather than \'begins with\' (to
    allow, e.g., searching by last name); and (2) limits results to 10 entries
    (to limit server load and limit effectiveness of email-scraping attacks) 

  * Fixed agenda oscillation problem (removed scrollbars from iframe)

  From cabo@tzi.org: 

  * Added javascript functionality to make the UTC agenda convert it's UTC
    times to Browser local time.

    addresses, instead of creating new accounts, on the create-account form.

  * Tweaked mergedevbranch to make the sprint merge/test cycle a little bit 
    easier.

  * Tweaked the code from [5518] to handle the case where a document 
    doesn't have any state set yet.

  * Changed the community tool email notification code to not try to send 
    to nobody, and to use individual To: addressing rather bulk Bcc: addressing.

ietfdb (4.42) ietf; urgency=high

  This release brings only minor new functionality to the datatracker
  (timezone indications on the html agenda, and an UTC version of the
  html agenda), but it's important because it includes the secretariat
  tools as part of the datatracker release and source repository, and
  makes the test suite also run secretariat app tests.
  
  Details:

  * Provides the html agenda for IETF meetings with local timezone indications,
    and adds a new html agenda with UTC timezone indications.

  * Merged in branch/amsl/trunkmerge@5449 from rcross@amsl.com, with some 
    tweaks.  This provides the secretariat apps.

  * In order that document states (which may be used by old documents) 
    should not need to be removed when state machines change and states go out 
    of use, all document states have a 'used' field.  The code which accesses 
    the state fields have not been requiring that used=True for the states 
    returned, which is an error.  Fixed this by adding 'used=True' to all 
    State.objects.get() and State.objects.filter() call where it's relevant.

  * Applied patch from olau@iola.dk for some email problems, see issues
    #949 and #877.

  * With RFC6410, there are only two RFC maturity levels, 'Proposed 
    Standard' and 'Internet Standard'. Added a mapping between 'Internet 
    Standard' and slug 'std', to be able to process newer RFC info from the RFC 
    Editor.

  This release is a minor release, with bugfixes and some enhancements
  to the community draft-tracking feeds.

  For detailed commit messages, please see:
    http://wiki.tools.ietf.org/tools/ietfdb/log/trunk

  * Added a set of help pages for document states, and dded links from the
    new IANA states to help pages describing the different states.

  * From rjsparks@nostrum.com:
    Fixed a bug in the state change logging which caused the wrong document
    state log entries in some cases.

  * Merged [5426] from ietf@augustcellars.com: 
    Make sure that the same rule cannot be entered twice in a community 
    list.

  * Merged [5425] from ietf@augustcellars.com: 
    Modify atom change feed so that 
    1.  It returns the last 14 days of changes rather than the last 20
    2.  Change the atom template so that it has correct time offsets rather 
    than saying that PST and UTC are the same
    3.  Change the atom template so that it uses content rather than 
    summary and return HTML content with line breaks as needed. 

  * Merged [5424] from ietf@augustcellars.com: 
    Close the image tag.  An empty image tag displays on IE although it 
    does not display on Firefox. 

  * Added variations on the recognized date formats during submitted draft 
    parsing, such that comma need not be followed by whitespace in the formats 
    using comma as a separator between some of the fields.  Added extraction of 
    drafts referenced by a document, in addition to RFCs referenced.

  * Modified the set of permissible parents for session groups, in order to 
    permit an IAB-sponsored BoF to appear on the agenda.

  **RFC-Editor and IANA Document State Data Exchange**

  This release is a major feature release, which provides the means to do
  state synchronization to and from the RFC-Editor and IANA, so that relevant
  state changes to drafts and RFCs at any of the 3 organizations can be
  picked up and reflected automatically in the tracking system used by the
  others.  

  This release is the last piece of a multi-year effort to make the tracker
  provide seamless tracking of state information from the very first beginnngs
  of a document (which is provided through the community tracker part of the
  IETD datatracker, which lets anyone in the community set up tracking
  notifications for their specific set of documents) all the way through the
  working group process, IESG processing, to the final IANA and REF-Editor
  processing and publication.

  There isn't a lot of eye-candy associated with the current release, but
  as we get the RFC-Editor and IANA ends set up to use the notification
  interfaces provided in this release, the state shown in the datatracker
  should faithfully and timely reflect the state changes in the RFC-Editor
  and IANA parts of the process.

  For detailed commit messages, please see:

ietfdb (4.37) ietf; urgency=low

  This is a minor bug-fix release of the datatracker.  It fixes issues with
  presentation of IESG discusses and comments, anchor names in the materials
  list page, details of the 1wg-summary.txt page, and some other minor issues.

  * Merged in a patch from housley@vigilsec.com to handle different 
    documents better in the agenda JSON output.

  * Added simple logging of test runs, to make it easier to be sure that 
    tests has been run successfully on the latest code.

  * Added a new field, #16: draft AD (name and email) to all_id2.txt

  * Made the IPR country field wider to accomodate IPR disclosures 
    referencing many patent instances in many countries.

  * Updated draft submission author extraction module to handle dash-separated
    double given names.

  * Tweaks and fixes to the IESG scribe template templates.

  * Added a filter for use in displaying document comments and discusses 
    which unfortunately sometimes use html <br> markup, which should give line 
    breaks, and sometimes contain <email@domain> which should *not* be 
    interpreted as html, but rendered as &lt;...

  * Limited the 1wg-summary list and friends to WGs, (excluding the 'iesg' 
    area which lists the areas as subgroups, for instance).

  * Resolved a naming conflict between the builtin messages framework and a 
    variable named messages in wgcharter.views.change_state.  Fixes issue #901.

  * Tweaked the handling of the syslog module not being available on 
    windows.

  * Fixed what may have been a regression in the form of the anchors in the 
    materials list page.

ietfdb (4.35) ietf; urgency=medium

  This release provides a long list of fixes and minor enhancements, covering
  more than 50 different items found through feedback from users.  Major
  contributors were Robert Sparks, Adam Roach, and Henrik.  The changelog will
  be available at http://datatracker.ietf.org/release/4.35 after deployment.
  The commit log is at http://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/ietfdb/log/trunk

  Details:

  * Added an 'email sent' success message after sending out a WG review 
    announcement.  Todo: Add equivalent messages in all other situations 
    where email is sent out, for consistency.

  * Added various things which lets us use Django's messages framework to 
    give feedback to users.  This includes adding the messages middleware in 
    settings.py, adding a message display are at the top of the page base 
    template, and adding style setting for message display.

  * Tweaked test/mergedevbranch in a number of places in order to simplify 
    handling (merging and testing) of multiple merges.

  * Merged [4909] from rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Reimplemented clear_ballot to close the existing ballot and create a 
    new one. Changed the all_positions code to only return synthetic 
    no-positions for current ADs when a ballot is actually open

    changelog format.

  * Added a simple page to show release information parsed from a release's 
    changelog file.

  * Improved the handling of iCalendar timezone information -- instead of 
    simplified VTIMEZONE information generated from a template, the VTIMEZONE 
    information for a meeting's timezone is read from file (where it presumably 
    has been generated from the Olson timezone database, for instance using 
    vzic.

  * Added an utility script to extract information about the outgoing 
    confirmation request email related to a draft submission.

  * Added a management command to generate bibxml files for drafts.  It's 
    not fully cooked yet, as it needs to differentiate between documents which 
    are currently drafts, and those that have been published as RFCs, but the 
    basics are there.

  * Add an name utility function to return a name's initials. Handle names 
    with an uppercase surname to the left of the given name correctly.

  * Added support for reverse-order (i.e., Japanese, Chinese, and other) 
    names with uppercase family name in the draft submission author extraction.

  * Added an 'agenda_note' field to meeting.models.Meeting, and added 
    display of content (if any) in html and txt agendas.

ietfdb (4.34) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Merged in [4772] from rjsparks@nostrum.com, a big chunk which in itself
    combines a number of separate fixes: 

    Liasion Manager:

    * Patch from Yaco to avoid resetting the From field when changing other 
      items on the form

    * Gave the secretariat the ability to find/approve any unapproved 
      liaisons

    * Changed all the email code to use ietf.mail.utils (and removed the 
      fake-mail concept)

    Charter documents and the Agenda pages:

    * Added charter documents to iesg/agenda and iesg/agenda/documents

    * Synced the ordering of drafts on iesg/agenda and iesg/agenda/documents

    * Allow setting a responsible AD for charter documents

    * Changed the UI of the charter page to use editlink for changing 
      attributes and buttons for actions (to align with drafts and 
      conflict-reviews)

    Moderator package:

    * Refactor: Simplified access to the current BallotDocEvent from a 
      Document

    * Added functions to BallotDocEvents? to faciliate access to 
      BallotPositionDocEvents?, both for all positions, and current AD postions.

    * Updated the moderator package to use the Documents from _agenda_data.

    * Added a filter to assist with rendering the moderator package.

    * Fixed a bug where different functions in idrfc/views_ballot were 
      using log_state_changed expecting different implementations (a cleanup task 
      should reconcile the _three_ implementations in the codebase of that 
      function).

    Cleanup from codesprint:

    * Removed some duplication between doc/util and doc/models by moving 
      things into doc/models

    * Do not show non-empty discuss text when the ballot position is not 
      blocking

    * Added a migration to update non-blocking ballot positions that have 
      non-empty discuss text

    DEPLOYMENT NOTES
    Please be aware that migration step will take a few minutes to complete.
    Fixes issue #865 

  * Tweaked the author extraction code to handle company names in the author
    list on the first page, when the company names contain a comma, such as
    for instance 'Foo Bar, Inc'.

  * Added support for get_file_path() for conflrev documents based on branch 
    /personal/rcross/v4.32@4722, but tweaked to return only the directory, not 
    the full directory+name+ext path, in order to behave the same way as for 
    other document types.

  * Merged in [4746] from adam@nostrum.com: 
    Adding slides to agenda page 

  * Merged in [4738] from adam@nostrum.com: 
    Added a link to the cookie page, at Robert's request 

  * Merged in [4737] from adam@nostrum.com: 
    Fixed profile update page to keep Alias table up to date. Also, roles 
    for inactive groups are no longer displayed on the profile page. 

  * Applied fix from rjsparks@nostrum.com: Remove old document filtering 
    which is now to strict, letting conflict review documents show in the iesg 
    agenda.

  * Applied fix from adam@nostrum.com: Display meeting materials with 
    correct ordering.

  * Removed the ValueError exceptions introduced in the previous revision 
    of the draft author extraction code.  Fixes issue #858.

  * Fixed problem with diff links which erroneously included a template 
    variable interpolation.

  * Fixed problem with displaying ISE stream documents.

  * Fixed the update password request form to *not* give an error for 
    existing accounts ,:-)

    an old form in a recent merge.

  * Used the .plain_name Person attribute in the agenda documents form 
    instead of the full .name attribute.

  * The call to liaison_manager_sdos() in set_organization_field was 
    missing a Person parameter -- added it.

    Adjusted the scribe template to make it XHTML compliant and fix what 
    Robert broke

    (agenda.json). 

  * Changesets [4720], [4706], and [4705] from adam@nostrum.com: 
    Adding self-management page for user profile information 

  * Changeset [4704] from suresh.krishnan@ericsson.com: 

    - When the state changes from whatever to Publication Requested, the 
      regular state change mail will go out.

    - The regular state change mail will be sent to the authors and the wg 
      chairs (this is the current behavior).

    - Now, in addition to this regular state change mail, another mail will 
      be sent with the title 'Publication has been requested for draft 
      <draft-name>' and this mail will be sent to the AD responsible for the WG. 
      I considered sending the mail to both the ADs but decided not to bother the 
      other AD :-).

  Conflict Review documents (conflrev-\*.txt).

  From rjsparks@nostrum.com:

  * Adds a new document type for conflict reviews, with a ballot for the IESG
    5742 response to a review request

    feeds)

  * Removed the Edit and Add buttons from the document main view.

  * Replaced Add with actions appropriate for the document type, such as
    "Begin IESG Processing" or "Begin IETF Conflict Review", and made most data
    directly editable on the document's main page, depending on access
    permissions.

  * Removed a manual editing step that the secretariat had to perform when
    sending conflict review messages. The view now composes the message
    correctly given the stream.

  * Added a pencil icon motif to differentiate fields that are editable.

  * Generalized several views and helper functions to use Document instead of
    (e.g.) IdWrapper

  * Generalized reading documents from the repository

  * Added a way to get from IdWrapper to the underlying Document to facilitate
    migrating way from the Wrapper classes

  * Added many helpers to Document to assist with migrating off IdWrapper

  * Minor fixes and other changes

    - Fixes to document main view to avoid (silent) template failures. 

    - Began removing some of the code that is no longer reachable post-migration

    - Corrected the behavior of the undefer code and added test cases for it

    - Improved initial population of notification lists and added the ability
      to regenerate the initial list

  * Made the test code that scans for template coverage more robust.

  Deployment notes:
    * new setting: CONFLICT_REVIEW_PATH. The associated directory will need to be created

ietfdb (4.31) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is primarily a bugfix-release, catching a lot of issues related to the
  most recent few releases.  

  A few features have also been included, liste first:

  * Added support for IRTF liaisons.

  * Improved I-D submission author extraction code, adding support for 
    extraction of affiliation, improved date format extraction, support
    for additional (unusual) name abbreviation patterns, and more.

  Bugfixes.  Not all fixes are mentioned here; for a complete list please see
  the commitlog.

  * Fixed a language typo in the registration confirmation page.

  * Tweaked the community tracker notification email.

  * Changed and tweaked various I-D submission emails in order to 1) make it 
    less likely that they would be classified as spam (better ratio of English 
    text to hash urls) and 2) provide better consistency in formatting of 
    key/value information.

  * From adam@nostrum.com: Fixed an URL in the agenda.csv file which hadn't 
    been updated to match current naming conventions and code.

  * Added new RFC-Editor state tag 'AUTH48-DONE' to the rfc-ed-queue mirror 
    script.

  * Tweaked the meeting materials list to avoid duplicate rows for WGs with 
    more than one slot, as long as the materials list is the same (which is the 
    only thing supported by other parts of the system at this time).

  * Applied ballot popup patch from olau@iola.dk.

  * Made links to other versions available also for expired documents.

  * Changed community I-D tracking rule update frequency to every hour.

  * Rewrote the view and template code for the meeting materials list, 
    which was showing nothing.  Better to do the rewrite for the new models 
    than trying to dig into why the proxy models doesn't work any more.

  * Fixed id_abstracts to include drafts assigned directly to areas, not 
    only individual and WG drafts.

  * Fixed 1wg-charters.txt (and friends) to not list the areas as if they were 
    WGs.

  * Updated utils/draft.py and modified the submit app code accordingly.

  * Merged in [4604] from adam@nostrum.com, which fixes problems with the 
    html agenda code related to the schema transition.

  * Ballot ids are limited to integers, rather than being descriptive as 
    intended at one point.  Adjusted the url regexes accordingly.  Patch from 
    olau@iola.dk.

  * Introduced a line break to clean up the state display for tracked drafts 
    a bit.

  * Make the link to the search form more prominent in the community list 
    explicitly added documents page.

  * Sorted WGs in the community rules drop-down list by acronym rather than 
    WG name.

  * Provided a more comprehensive document state indication.  May need 
    further refinement.

  * Tweaked the community tracker links in the lefthand menubar to avoid 
    line breaking for the WG documents link visible to WG chairs.

  * Enabled the check for existing account, disabled when we started using 
    self-service http password reset, but hadn't started creating accounts yet. 

  * Refactored the two confirm*() methods in ietfauth/views.py; they need the 
    same processing, only the templates to use differ.

  * Fixed the back-link on personal list email subscription confirmation page -- 
    it just lead to the confirmation page itself, now leads to read-only list 
    view.

  * When logged in as secretariat, at /iesg/agenda/ or 
    /iesg/agenda/documents/, and clicking on the position matrix for a 
    document, the overlay window would give a code 500 error, because of a 
    missing ballot id in the templates' url lookup.  Fix this by providing the 
    ballot id.

  **Community Document Tracking Support**

  This is a feature release which provides the community document tracking
  functionality defined in RFC 6293.

  * Merged community tracking branch from esanchez@yaco.es, 
    r3175-3679,3713-3830.

  Some additional fixes and smaller upgrades have also been included, as
  follows:

  From esanchez@yaco.es:

  * Patch to add a new IETF liaison-sending entity "IESG and IAB".

  From olau@iola.dk:

  * Small patch to avoid constant 500 traceback when someone tries to push an
    invalid cookie.

  From henrik@levkowetz.com:

  * Fix a bug which made the community tracking code crash when search 
    results would show an old RFC without an associated draft.

  * Tweak the menubar listing of community tracking to show when login is 
    needed, some other text tweaks, and fitting the I-D tracking links under 
    Drafts and RFCs where they seem to belon.g

  * Minor cleanup of test_runner.py. Added guards against settings which 
    can make tests inexplicably fail.  Updated check to avoid running tests on 
    production server.

  * Remove old non-functional "management issues" link from IESG agenda 
    section 6 title.

  * Add a way to reach charter urls given a wg name rather than the charter 
    document name.

  * Add some help for chairs which fuss about not being able to clearly see 
    that they need to be logged in in order to handle approvals.

  * Behave slightly more gracefully if a submission has already been moved 
    into place, and we are asked to do it again.

  * Disable the reference-to/referenced-by rules of the community app;
    they will only produce hits after we populate the document relationship
    table with reference information.

  * Simplify "document by WG" display name code.

  * Correct typo in community draft tracking subscription confirmation 
    email.

  * Changed the group link on the personal doc list page to use the group 
    acronym instead of whole name, and made the acronym a link to the wg 
    documents page.

  * Tweaked the display of explicitly added documents (saying "explicitly" 
    rather than "manually", and including the active/expired/rfc state of the 
    document.

  * When adding a rule for I-Ds, only apply the selection to active I-Ds,
    not those which are expired or published.

  * Changes to the rule specifications for document tracking lists: 
    Simplify the filter rules, show acronym in wg and area selection lists, 
    list only ADs of active areas.

  * Fixups to the merged code, to match the code refactoring done to trunk
    after the split off of the community development branch.

  * Removed the grep based searches in utils.py; they are too costly.  If 
    tracing lists based on word search is needed, another implementation must 
    be found.

  * Other minor cleanup.

ietfdb (4.21) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is a bugfix release for the charter release (4.20) with some
  extra changes which were pending: Updated via-rfc-editor handling,
  better /meeting/requests page, added WG document approval page.

  From olau@iola.dk:  

  * Add approval/pre-approval page for Secretariat and WG Chairs, with
    subpages for adding and canceling pre-approvals and a set of
    migrations for replacing the old IdApprovedDetail with a slightly less
    confusing Preapproval model.

  * Add listing of recently approved drafts to approval page by request
    from Barry Leiba.

  * Replace get_profile() hack with a test on the user instead, this
    also makes the ballot icon more robust against users without profiles
    (which shouldn't happen, but apparently we sometimes get one which
    results in a crash rather than something more graceful)

  * Give the incoming name to the top renderer so the links are internally
    consistent, this is needed because we still have different views for
    /doc/rfcXXXX/ and /doc/draft-foo-bar/

  * Fix regexp fix - [.-_] does not mean "dot or dash or underscore", it
    means all characters between dot and underscore

  * Include _ in allowed document name regexp, we currently have 7 drafts
    with _ in the database despite it not being valid - they can be found
    with:
    select name from doc_document where name like '%\_%' and type_id = "draft";

  * Fix flow of approval of charters/announcement of the WG action based
    on feedback from Cindy Morgan, now there's a link on the approval page
    to go to the edit page which sends you back upon saving, and the edit
    page doesn't provide a button to send the announcement since you
    should do that on the approve page (instead it provides a link).

  * Include current milestones in charter action/review announcements,
    fixes issue #835.

  * Add CC for group mailing list in action/review emails, fixes issue #837.

  * Fix link to charter .txt file on agenda page

  * Apparently, CHARTER_TXT_URL http://www.ietf.org/charters/ is really
    http://www.ietf.org/charter/, fix this in the settings.py file

  * Replace get_profile() hack with a test on the user instead, this
    also makes the ballot icon more robust against users without profiles
    (which shouldn't happen, but apparently we sometimes get one which
    results in a crash rather than something more graceful)

  * Give the incoming name to the top renderer so the links are internally
    consistent, this is needed because we still have different views for
    /doc/rfcXXXX/ and /doc/draft-foo-bar/

  * Fix regexp fix - [.-_] does not mean "dot or dash or underscore", it
    means all characters between dot and underscore

  * Include _ in allowed document name regexp, we currently have 7 drafts
    with _ in the database despite it not being valid - they can be found
    with:
    select name from doc_document where name like '%\_%' and type_id = "draft";

  * Fix flow of approval of charters/announcement of the WG action based
    on feedback from Cindy Morgan, now there's a link on the approval page
    to go to the edit page which sends you back upon saving, and the edit
    page doesn't provide a button to send the announcement since you
    should do that on the approve page (instead it provides a link).

  * Include current milestones in charter action/review announcements,
    fixes issue #835.

  * Add CC for group mailing list in action/review emails, fixes issue #837.

  * Fix link to charter .txt file on agenda page

  From rjsparks@nostrum.com:

  * Expose how many pages each document contains on the docs on future
    telechats page.  Fixes bug #828

  * Replaced the concept of a tag (via-rfc) identifying ise or irtf document
    (previously the idinternal.via_rfc_editor boolean) with looking at the
    document's stream.  Removed the stream editing form - that functionality
    is on the edit info form.  Put the old-ADs back into the list of choices
    when editing a document's info.  This (re) fixes bug #749

  * Fixed a bug in determining if a document is on the agenda, leftover
    from transition to new schema.

  From adam@nostrum.com:

  * Fix to the requests data page:

     - uses native schema for much greater efficiency

     - Uses meeting ID properly, so it can find future meetings
       even if their ID does not match the meeting number

     - Dramatic improvements to layout

  From henrik@levkowetz.com:

  * Try to not use explicit .html extensions in the urls.  Redirect from 
    those to .html-less urls.

  * Added a new field 'short' to Session, to help produce file names for 
    agendas, minutes and slides for groups with different named session, such 
    as for instance 'edu'.  Generating distinct filenames directly from the 
    name field gives too long names.

  * Quick fix for extensionless get_absolute_url().  XXX Fixme: needs 
    bigger refactoring.

  * Quick fix for crash when going to /wg/imapmove/charter/.  I'm not happy 
    about the 'charter-ietf-' constant which now appears several places in the 
    code; we need settings which defines the correct name pattern for different 
    document types (or a table or table column, maybe).  But this hopefully 
    will make it possible to continue processing proposed WGs ...

  * Added missing '{{' before 'submission.filename' in draft announcement 
    email templates.

  * Other minor fixes

  * Don't try to call get_profile() on a user if the method isn't available.

  * Merged in fixes from Ole, from branch/charter:r4382-4407, and some 
    changes from Henrik (removing the use of pos.blocked in views_ballot.py, 
    and setting a ballot id in idrfc/testsREDESIGN.py) to make 
    idrfc.EditPositionTestCase succeed.

  * Don't include interim meetings in those considered for the default 
    meeting number for the '/meeting/' url.

  * Tweaked the error messages for acronym collisions in the create-wg form.

  * Added quotes around the WG name in the state change text, for better 
    readability.

  * Applied a fix to missing nomcom chair in [4384] instead of [4385].

  * Made arguments to url help_charter_states match the definition in 
    ietf/idrfc/urls.py.

  * Fixed a bug in picking up blocking text (patch provided by olau@iola.dk).

  * Added a parameter to make the commitlog script useful for other branches 
    than the current.

  * Catch exception which is raised if a nomcom NN group has been created, 
    but no nomcom chair has been announced and added yet.

  Merged in [4364] from rjsparks@nostrum.com:

  * Expose how many pages each document contains on the docs on future 
    telechats page. Fixes bug #828 

  Merged in fixes to the charter branch (r4345 - r4353 and r4354 - r4381)
  from olau@iola.dk.:

  * Check and sanitize text file upload (code is factored out in a new
    helper so it can be reused elsewhere in the future).

  * Move charter state help to /doc/help/state/charter/.

  * Say "generate" rather than "edit" when there's no text in the boxes

  * Don't show diff box if there's only 1 entry (and itself).

  * Say "Charter" rather than "Recharter" on the charter /doc/ page if the 
    group is proposed or a BoF.

  * Treat BoF as proposed WG.

  * s/WG/group/ in acronym clash error message.

  * Add a star to the required fields.

  * Fix test broken by previous commit.

  * Fix buggy new group acronym check.

  * Amend previous commit to generate writeups on entering internal review 
    instead.

  * Generate action and review text automatically.

  * Make phrasing sligtly more clear.

  * Make it move obvious what the change state view actually does by
    rephrasing the form.

  * Fix some phrasing bugs.

  * Fix terminology confusion and say "send ballot" rather than "issue
    ballot" to clear up that it is not actually created.

  * Fix wording of send ballot comment, the actual text was still specific
    to drafts.

  * Don't show edit button for snapshots.

  * Fix bug in hiding "external review needed" checkbox.

  * Create charters in state notrev instead of intrev, as a side effect
    this fixes a problem with comments not being saved when starting
    review on charter.

  * Use revision numbers to identify ballots and put a warning on closed 
    ballots.

  * Fix bug in event description when copying over the final approved
    charter file.

  * Offer text from latest approved revision in case there's no initial text
    for a recharter submit form.

  * Reverse direction of revisions on charter /doc/ page to match 
    tools.ietf.org/html/draft-\*.

  * Change max acronym length to 10 instead of 8

  Additional fixes from Henrik:

  * Fixed the signature of DocEventAdmin method (needs explicit 'self' parameter)

  * Added various fixes and correction of merge errors.

  * Merged in fixes to the migration from olau@iola.dk.

  * Merged in the charter branch from olau@iola.dk.

  From Adam:

  * Added a fix for empty .ics files

ietfdb (4.02) ietf; urgency=medium

  Merged [4288] from rjsparks@nostrum.com: 

  * Made several changes to correctly use the new (RFC6410)  "Internet Standard" level
    in email that gets sent at various stages in the handling of documents.  Fixes bug 821.

  * [4319]: Only query for regular IETF meetings when calculating cut off dates
    (reported by Ryan Cross).

  * [4311]: Fix bug in liaison form that prevents Secretariat users from posting
    statements on behalf of SDO liaison managers in some cases.

  * [4310]: Fix problem with direct replyto path in liaison form not using role
    emails (reported by Stephanie McCammon).

  * [4307]: Fix missing return in liaison proxy, fixes problem with from email
    on https://datatracker.ietf.org/liaison/1154/ as reported by Stephanie
    McCammon.

  * [4260]: Move note about IANA scraping messages, apparently I managed to
    put it in the wrong place (they're of course scraping draft approvals, not
    the ballot announcements).

  * [4253]: Move last call announcement text to last call event rather than
    stuffing it inside the state change event.

  * [4252]: Declare coding system to work around annoying problem when the
    date produced by SVN is localized.

  **IETF 83 Code Sprint**

  * Made various fixes to test cases in order to support the new code and
    database setup.

  * Merged [4265] from adam@nostrum.com: 
    Migrated HTML agenda to new data model. This has several improvements, 
    as well, such as clearer marking of BOFs. 

  * Merged [4226] from adam@nostrum.com: 
    Updated agenda.ics to use new data model. Also, tons more efficient. 
    Additionally, the description field now includes links to relevant meeting

  * Merged [4224] from york@isoc.org: 
    Related to #816 - Modified base.html so that the logo is clickable as 
    well as the text.

  **IETF 82 Code Sprint**

  This release contains the features and bugfixes from the IETF-82
  code sprint.

  From adam@nostrum.com: 

  * Fixed a bug in is_authorized_in_draft_stream: would never return true 
    for WG chairs.

  From lars.eggert@nokia.com: 

  * Automatically set the recipients of RFC5742 review emails sent by the 
    IESG based on the RFC Stream. 

  * Fixed a typo. 

  From rjsparks@nostrum.com: 

  * Marked area directors who are not on the current IESG with square 
    brackets on the discuss summary page.  Fixes bug 666.

  * Changed the AD status page to group documents by current state.
    Fixes bug 742.

  * Changed the edit info form to allow (force) setting the stream when 
    editing or adding a document to the iesg tracker.  Fixes bug 743.

  From henrik@levkowetz.com:

  * Added a colour indication to the Area/WG overview page showing 
    responsible AD for each WG.  Also some html reformatting for better 
    readability.

  * Be more specific about the submission startup time on meeting Monday.  
    Indicate time and timezone for more cases on the submission form.

  * Various fixes to test fixtures and admin pages.

ietfdb (3.63) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is a feature release which adds support for Alternate Stream draft
  tracking, similar to the WG Chair draft tracking.  Some bug fixes have
  also been included.

  From esanchez@yaco.es:

  * Merged /branch/yaco/wgchairs.r3120:r3154-3558 from esanchez@yaco.es.  
    This adds support for alternate streams document tracking, similar to the 
    WG chairs tracking functionality.

  * Merged /branch/yaco/wgchairs.r3120/static/media:r3152-3153.  Do not 
    show the draft addoption form when editing stream. See #671.

  * Merged /branch/yaco/wgchairs.r3120/static/media:r3122-3152.  Do no try 
    to create an already existing model. See #671.

  From henrik@levkowetz.com:  

  * Improved handling of a particular IO Error that sometimes occur during 
    draft submission.

  * Removed some of the bling and unnecessary information from the document 
    WG state display.

  * Aligned the workflow admin display lists with the current model fields.

ietfdb (3.62) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is a minor bugfix release in preparation for merging in the Alternate
  Streams draft tracker enhancements.

  * Fixed a problem where server IO failures could be silently discarded
    resulting in an ID submission upload being quietly ignored, returning
    the upload form anew.

  * Changed to a more helpful text on the 500 server error page.

  * Tweaked various submission cutoff message strings.  Also made the cut-off
    messages use the actual hour defined in settings, rather than a hardcoded
    string saying '5 PM (PT)' ...

  * Cleaned up the display of 'Sign In' and version number when rendering the 
    base template without context (which is the case for the 500 server error 
    template).

  * Fixed a wrong settings variable (introduced when merging code from the 
    yaco idsubmit branch for v3.61).  Refine the error report for failures to 
    move files from staging to repository.

  * Refined the admin list page for submission details a bit.

  * Change the 'Sign In' link to be https, preventing clear-text passwords
    over the wire (given the current use of basic http auth, rather than
    diget auth, on the web server).

  * Added a 'Report a bug' link in the lefthand column, below the version
    indication.

  * The cutoff hour setting is in UTC, not PST or PDT.  Adjusted 
    accordingly in the settings file.

  From esanchez@yaco.es: 

  * Check for missed files on staging area. Fixes #707 

  * Validate title extraction. Fixes #706 

  From henrik@levkowetz.com:

  * Improved extraction of draft title during submission.

  * Fixed a problem where the scan for an author's email address was
    prematurely terminated because another author's affiliation also was part
    of this author's address information.

  * Changed the length of the username field from 30 to 64 characters,
    to avoid datatracker login problems for people with long email
    addresses.

  * Speeded up things and increased reliability during submission author
    information extraction by looking for a recognizable author's address
    section, and not searching for author names earlier in the document if
    found.  Fixes a known bad case where the author name occurred in the
    middle of a draft.

  * Added handling for the case where an author name is followed by 
    parentheses which are not closed on the same line.

  * Added some columns to the admin interface for WgProceedingsActivities.
    Fixed breakage in the feeds code caused by table entries for this model
    containing meeting FKs which don't have an associated meeting entry.  The
    base problem of broken table entries remain, though.

    Added a link to the ARO search including the IESG lists 

  * Merged [3249] from suresh.krishnan@ericsson.com: 
    Allowing adding documents in AD is watching state in addition to the 
    default Publication Requested state. Fixes issue #684 

  * Merged [3245] from rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Removes the "Change State" button and makes changing state a link 
    further up on the form.  This fixes bug 683, but creates a new one that
    we will need to address later - editing the state of an RFC that is going
    through the iesg process again (for going to draft in place for example)
    will need followup once the changes to get an rfc into that state easily
    are made.

    Adding page to allow viewing meeting slot requests as they are made. 
    There's no link to these yet. 

  * Merged [3240] from adam@nostrum.com:

    - Fix a bug where the wrong text was shown for IPR declarations which 
      specified that licensing terms would be announced later (option d).

    - Fix a bug where the plenary entries in the html agenda didn't have 
      links to the room map.

    - Enhance the admin list page for Stream a bit.

    - Add some debug output utility functions.

    - Tweak the admin list for WgMeetingSession to show wg acronym instead of 
      group id.

  This is a minor release with various bugfixes and minor admin enhancements.
  The most long-term noticable enhancement is added support for app- and
  module-specific admin email addresses which will receive stack traces on
  uncaught exceptions.

  Details:

  * Change the cutoff-settings to match what's desired.  Move CUTOFF_HOUR 
    to settings.  Change the submission page template to not show the form 
    during the down period.

  * Set up app-specific email addresses so the respective developers will 
    be notified about failures in code they have worked with.  Make django
    pick up app- and module-specific admin email addresses for stack trace
    messages.

  * Make admin form lists work a bit better with non-ascii content in 
    non-unicode tables.

  * Admin support for StreamedID, so one can look at it.

  * Get person info without limiting hits to iesglogins.  WG Chairs will have 
    logins but not IESG logins ...

  * Tweak ipr search to only look for IPRs in the appropriate state.

  * Tweak PersonOrOrgName.email() to handle non-ascii names a bit better.

  * Don't let the linewrapping algorithm churn infinitely.

  * Some IPR admin tweaks.  Provide a __unicode__ method and show a contact 
    even if multiple have been set for an IPR declaration.

  This release adds the wgchair tracker functionality, and also contains
  some bugfixes.

  Feature:

  * Merged in branch branch/yaco/wgchairs from esanchez@yaco.es.  This 
    provides the WG Chair Tracker functionality.

  Fixes:

  * Changed the default initial state for a WG document to 'WG Document', 
    instead of 'Call for Adoption ...'.

  * Labelled the link to edit a document's WG state 'Change WG State', in 
    order to not confuse it with changing the IESG state.

  * Reordered the state information for a document into related groups, 
    separated by rulers.  Add some indentation to the template code to make it 
    a bit easier to read in some places.

  * Made the WG a draft belongs to into a link to the WG page.

  * Corrected an inappropriate use of the idsubmission repository location 
    instead of the ID repository.  Reported by Robert Sparks.

  * Correct the text (add an omitted word 'press').  Reported by Tomas Narten.

  * Fixed a problem with author extraction when a given name is the same as 
    the surname.

  * Only try to return a shepherd for a document if one has been assigned 
    to the document.

  * Merged in changes from esanchez@yaco.es, changeset [3067].  Makes 
    Liaisons' Date field editable.

  * Added a bit of admin goodness for MeetingSessions.

  From rjsparks@nostrum.com:

  * Restructured the position editing page to better integrate the defer button.
    Fixes bug #659

  * Copied the jquery-1.5.1.min.js library into /static/js/lib (from
    /static/js) because that's where the main document template was looking for
    it. There have probably been several problems since the change that left
    this dangling that showed up as things not behaving, but not as errors. The
    one that clued me in was the discuss text-box not being hidden when the
    position wasn't DISCUSS.  They should all behave better now.

  * Added a django form validator to the discuss text field to not allow
    actions when the position is Discuss, but the discuss-text is empty.  2 and
    3 together fix bug #660

  * Added logic to the undefer fuction to put the document back on the
    previous telechat (if that hasn't already passed). That is, date1 from
    telechat dates, and not date2.  Fixes bug #661

  * Changed the last_call_announcement generation function's template to
    include the abstracts from the document sets (which with modern usage means
    the abstract of the document) reflecting the IESGs decision of a few months
    back.  Fixes bug #662

  * Removed the old tracker link from the document's main page. Fixes bug #663 

  From henrik@levkowetz.com:

  * Handle email recipient lists which contain 'None' elements correctly.
    Fixes an instance of failure to send notifications about a submitted
    draft where an author email address was missing.

  * Add an admin interface to the I-D submission app, to make it easier to
    handle manual tasks related to submissions.

  * Add the submission hash to initial-revision-approval emails to WG chairs,
    so their approvals will take effect.  Fixes a problem where WG Chair
    approvals of WG draft submissions didn't take effect

  * Apply 'autoescape off' to all email templates which don'have it but 
    might need it, to avoid html entity escapes in emails.  Fixes another
    set of instances where this potentially could occur.

  * We cannot currently assume that BallotInfo entries matching 
    IDInternal.ballot exists. It seems ballot may be set to a value before the 
    actual ballot entry is created, possibly by some old secretariat tool. Very 
    broken, but we need to survive it :-(  Fixes a crash in the admin
    interface.

  * Reordered entries of submission forms and notification emails to be
    more appropriate.

  * Changed wrapping of formatted text to expand tabs during text wrapping, in
    order to get consistent indentation handling.

  From esanches@yaco.es:

  * Do not allow cancellation of submissions with GET requests, and Ensure
    that 'get full url', 'approve' and 'force' views are called via POST
    request. Insert a button to perform the last step of autopost via POST
    request. Fixes #650  

  * Do not assume that the two_pages_field field is not None. Fixes #651

  * Allow creation dates that are 3 days after or 3 days before the current
    date. Fixes #652

  * Change substate from Revised ID Needed to AD Followup if needed. Fixes #654

  * Fix expected revision for expired drafts. Fixes #656

  * Send announcements when posting new version of a draft. Fixes #649

  From henrik@levkowetz.com:

  * Previous IPR information in last call announcements could be 
    incomplete.  Use a better search for IPR declarations related to a 
    document, and include the IPR information in the last call preview.
    Fixes an AD request and a request from the IESG

  * When extracting meta-information from drafts, it is required that some 
    data reside on the first page.  Split unpaginated drafts into chunks so we 
    can adhere better to this.  Fixes a bug where submission filename was
    picked up (incorrectly) later in a document.

  * Wrap long lines in the 'save and send email' view of AD ballot comments 
    and discusses.  Fixes a request from the IESG

  * Give development and test deployment a /robots.txt which doesn't permit 
    robots.  Avoids indexing of development servers by web spiders.

  **Submission Tool Rewrite**

  * For this release, the idsubmit port from esanchez@yaco.es has been merged
    in, which constitute substantial added functionality.  This integrates the
    draft upload functionality with the python/django datatracker; it improves
    draft submission handling and security, and fixes problems with database
    breakage and inconsistency caused by the old implementation.  With this also
    comes a major improvement of author extraction from draft text, provided by
    the ietf/utils/draft.py module from henrik@levkowetz.com.

  * Deployment note:  Once the new release has been placed in its deployment
    directory, and the correct settings_local.py has been copied in, a command
    needs to be run in order to update the database tables to work with the new
    code.  In the directory containing the ietf/ directory, run this command:

        $ PYTHONPATH=$PWD ietf/manage.py migrate

    The output should be as follows::

	Running migrations for liaisons:
	- Nothing to migrate.
	Running migrations for submit:
	 - Migrating forwards to 0003_add_extra_name_fields.
	 > submit: 0001_initial
	 > submit: 0002_add_submission_hash
	 > submit: 0003_add_extra_name_fields
	 - Loading initial data for submit.

    Once this is done, the regular deployment routine should be continued.

    liaisons editable.

  * Set the 'person' field of the LegacyLiaisonUser in the admin interface 
    to be handled as a raw id field with search button, rather than as a choice 
    list.  This should make admin updates involving the LegacyLiaisonUser table
    much speedier.

  * Added a new fix for empty query strings to /meeting/agenda/agenda.ics.  
    (The QUERY_STRING in request.META is not set the same way under the builtin
    server as under Apache; under apache there will be a QUERY_STRING entry wich
    is explicitly Null.  Handles this.)

  * Included a javascript change not previsously merged in from branch/yaco/liaison/.

ietfdb (3.15) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is a minor bugfix release.

  * Fix the weekday-dependent plenary information in the materials list.

  * In urls under /wg/, only accept wgnames which adhere to the constraints
    currently practiced.  (Before this change, the URL patterns would match wg
    names containing non-ascii characters, which later would bomb due to mix of
    collations when accessing the database. Might as well return a 404 at once
    instead).

  * Don't return 500 if the /meeting/agenda/agenda.ics URL is without query part.

  * Get rid of a print statement used during testing.

  * From adam@nostrum.com: 
    Meeting boxes now expand to reveal all text when users hover over them.
    Fixes ticket #602. 

  * From kivinen@iki.fi: 
    Added an URL to retrieve a text/plain version of the list of drafts for
    a given WG.  Useful for building WG-speific ePub documents of a WG's
    drafts.

  * From shane@time-travellers.org:
    Updated the JavaScript associated with the search page to 
    control whether the 'search' button is enabled or not. It is
    now enabled if either the main search box has input, or if
    any of the sub-options have input, or both.

  * From rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Adds a view of documents currently in IETF Last Call.  Fixes #630.

  * From bmheight@gmail.com:
    Remove explicit URLs in the code, using reverse() and the newly created
    helper function reverse_lazy().  Fixes #628.

  * From rjsparks@nostrum.com: 
    Changed the way ballot discuss/comment texts are displayed to
    put the text from current ADs first, and mark ex-ADs with []
    following the convention on the left bar.  This fixes issue #608 

  * From adam@nostrum.com:

  * From peter.musgrave@magorcorp.com: 
    Add IPR column to IESG Telechat Agenda.  Fixes issue #552.

  * Add refinements for the liaison admin interface.  Show contact link and 
    coloured Login/User links to show broken entries.

  * Wrap the sdo name query in a try clause to avoid server 500 errors.

  * Only try to populate the liaison user/email list from the from_entity 
    if it's set.

  * Make the document announcement default Cc: somewhat configurable.  
    Remove iab@iab.org (on request).

  * Link to the State help page from the 'State:' label.

  * Don't use '&lt;' and '&gt;' in text/plain email text.

  * Don't permit just any characters in the document name; limit this to 
    characters we currently permit in the names, or which has occurred in 
    posted documents.  Fixes a problem where non-ascii characters were 
    propagated to the database search and caused collation sequence exceptions, 
    instead of giving 404 errors.

  * Remove the To/From/Subject headers from extra headers to prevent 
    duplicate headers.

  Note: Deploying this release requires a database schema update, see below.

  From esanches@yaco.es:

  * Allow an SDO Liason Manager to send outgoing liaison from any IETF
    Entity to his SDO.

  * Allow the secretariat to send liaisons on behalf of another user.

  * On login, retrieve the person record related to the login from the 
    legacy tables of non IESG logins. Provides the link between login name
    and person listed in the liaison manager table.  Fixes #576.

  * Refined handling of the To: and From: address lists when the Liaison
    Manager is also a WG Chair or AD.

  From henrik@levkowetz.com:

  * Add a clean_whitespace filter in some places to get rid of any newlines 
    embedded in document titles.  Fixes a problem with bad email headers
    in announcements related to documents with newlines embedded in the title.

  * Don't try to send out mail which has no recipients.  Fixes a crash when
    trying to send announcements related to drafts which have an empty
    'email notes to' field.

  * Fix typo in method calls to send email, fixes a crash when submitting
    liaison statements.

  * Renamed 'LiaisonDetail.taken_care' field to 'action_taken'.  
    Miscellaneous associated fixes.  Enhanced liaison-related admin pages.

  Note: Deploying this release requires an additional steps to create
    a new column in a table.  This is done as a South migration
    (see http://south.aeracode.org/ for more info on South):

  * Fixed a bug in the IPR Search, where searches against the IPR notice
    content would fail (Only try to open a legacy url if it leads to a
    file; not if it leads to a directory).

  * For a new IESG tracker document, only add a history comment about
    previous history if some previous history exists (i.e., if the replaced 
    document also existed in the IESG tracker).

  * Show status of Dead Expired documents appropriately; just 'Expired' is 
    insufficient.

  * Restore, for the secretariat only, the re-scheduling functionality of 
    the /iesg/agenda/documents/ page which was removed in [2366] as the ADs 
    felt that it made the page too busy.

  * Propagate all extra fields on to the final email sending function, not 
    only the Cc and Bcc fields.  Restores previously missing Reply-To: headers.

  * Turn autoescaping off for everything in text/plain email templates.  Fixes
    multiple problems with '<' and '>' in emails showing up as '&lt;' and
    '&gt;', and related problems.

  * The liaison tool is deployed.  Show the links to the new tool.

  * Prevent things from crashing if some of the email fields are null for a 
    liaison.

  * It should be possible to edit the area of a draft even if it's been set 
    before.  Re-enabled the area list box on the document/edit/info/ page.

  * Corrected spelling error in list_display specification for the 
    PersonOrOrgInfo Admin page.

  * Corrected the path to the draft archive in the settings file.

    (Some of the fixes above has been deployed already before this release
    by patching the previous release on the server.)

  * Fix for #525. Adds more information to the document history tab,
    specifically changes to writeup, announcement and last-call text.

  * Fix for #372. Makes the position editing form display the name of the

  * Fix for #526 and #530: Change the format of the notification email sent
    out when an AD posts a ballot position on a draft, it by default CCs that
    email to the authors and chairs, and adds some explanatory text to the body
    of those messages. 

  From rjsparks@nostrum.com:

    language the tracker uses when no IPR declarations are found directly on the
    draft. Fixes #506

  * Retained search results on login. Fixes #482.

  * Added filename to the subject of Protocol Action and Document Action email
    messages (and fixed a bug that was preventing CC/BCC from being honored).

  From fenner@fenron.net: 

  * Split the /doc/ tabs into separate pages. This fixes #533. (Eventually,
    this will use <link rel=prefetch> to ask the tabs to be prefetched when the
    first tab is loaded, as documented at
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Link_prefetching_FAQ, but as there is some
    issues with this which haven't been fully resolved, the prefetch part is not
    part of this release.)

    This fixes #513

  * Added support for admin site documentation

  * Ported scripts for expiration of drafts and last-calls, and sending
    scheduled announcements.

    The command-line front-ends are in bin/ as expire-ids, expire-last-calls
    and send-scheduled-mail. The last one already existed with some code, but
    it's not certain it actually worked. The new one accepts the same arguments
    as the Perl script (there's a little bit of help if you run it).

    All three log to syslog.  They need to be started from cron with
    PYTHONPATH=/a/www/ietf-datatracker/web , in the same manner as other
    scripts which use the django models to interact with the database.

ietfdb (3.07) ietf; urgency=medium

  From esanchez@yaco.es:

  * Merged in Yaco's Liaison Management Tool Port & Rewrite.  Enjoy!

  Note: Deploying this release requires additional steps; to verify
  that liaison related settings in settings.py are correct, and to create
  new tables and update existing tables and table content.  The latter
  is done as South migrations (see http://south.aeracode.org/ for more
  info on the South app).  More extensiive documentation about the actions
  needed are provided in the user manual (doc/LSMT_user_manual.pdf in
  the release).  The brief version follows::

    # 8<----------
    # First the regular checkout and prepare:

       cd /a/www/ietf-datatracker
       svn co http://svn.tools.ietf.org/svn/tools/ietfdb/tags/3.07
       cp web/ietf/settings_local.py 3.07/ietf/
       cd 3.07

    # Verify that the new variables in settings.py are correct; if not,
    # add the correct settings in settings_local.py and inform the release
    # manager of the correct settings so they can be incorporated in the
    # next release.  The variables in question are (as set in the release):
    #
    # # The email address from wich all liaison emails come:
    # LIAISON_UNIVERSAL_FROM = 'Liaison Statement Management Tool <lsmt@' + IETF_DOMAIN + '>'
    #
    # # The filesystem path where the liaison attachments will be saved:
    # LIAISON_ATTACH_PATH = '/a/www/ietf-datatracker/documents/LIAISON/'
    #
    # # The url from where the webserver serves the liaison attachments
    # LIAISON_ATTACH_URL = '/documents/LIAISON/'

    # Next, the changes to the MySQL tables will be done.
    # You can list the table migrations which will be applied if desired,
    # this should list migrations from 0001_... to 0009_... under liaisons:

       PYTHONPATH=$PWD ietf/manage.py migrate --list

    # Apply the migrations:
 
       PYTHONPATH=$PWD ietf/manage.py migrate

    # Add the static/doc location as statically served files to the apache
    # configuration.  Fix line 6 in etc/apache2/vhoosts.d/ietf-datatracker.common
    # to read:
    #  <LocationMatch "^/(?!(cgi-bin|css|documents|error|idst|images|js|media|doc|private)/|robots.txt).*$">
    # (i.e., add '|doc' to the exception list).

    # Then carry on with the usual actions:

       cd ../
       rm ./web; ln -s 3.07 web
       sudo /etc/init.d/apache restart

    # 8<----------

  Once the datatracker is up and running with the new liaison tool in
  place, liaison role assignments have to be done as described in
  the LSMT user manual (in doc/LSMT_user_manual.pdf) page 14, summarized
  by Patrik on the yaco-liaison-tool mailing list:

    1. Add the IAB and IETF chairs, wg chairs, area directors etc as
    apropriate (as described in the document).

    2. Add the liaisons in the IETF assigned and named on the IAB list of
    liaisons.

  From rjsparks@nostrum.com:

  * Changed the navigation round editing ballots and sending discuss/email so
    that the user comes back to the page the edit started from.

  * Fix for ticket #374 (all in base.js) and removal of a vestigial 'save all
    changes' button from the iesg/agenda/documents page.

  * Split the ballot writeups page into three pages, for a more
    understandable user interface.

  **IETF 78 Code Sprint**

  * From Adam Roach: Make the selectable WG agenda feature of the datatracker
    IETF Agenda less resource intensive by not preloading all WG agendas.

  * From Peter Musgrave: Improve the selection of listed 'related documents'
    on the WG document pages.

  * From olau@iola.dk: Fix for issue #351 which caused server error when
    editing the state of a document (as IESG user).

  The following features were included already in v3.03, but by mistake
  weren't listed in the changelog for that revision:

  * IETF 78 Sprint code from Peter Musgrave: Add related documents section to
    the wg documents page (e.g., /wg/sipclf/).

  * IETF 78 Sprint code from Robert Sparks: Relabel the 'Issue Ballot' button
    (for AD use, on the draft info page).

  * IETF 78 Sprint code from Robert Sparks: provide a downloadable tarball of
    the documents on the IESG agenda of a given date.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  28 Jul 2010 16:13:23 +0200

ietfdb (3.03) ietf; urgency=medium

  * IETF 78 Sprint code from Adam Roach: Make the IETF agenda page view 
    user-modifiable, providing a custom bookmarkable agenda view for each user.

  * Make WG agendas available trough datatracker URLs; this will avoid 
    problems when the text from these pages are incorporated in frames in other 
    datatracker pages.  Example: /meeting/78/agenda/sipcore

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  27 Jul 2010 15:09:56 +0200

ietfdb (3.02) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Remove the per-document rescheduling dropdown boxes from the future iesg
    telechat document list (/iesg/agenda/documents/).  Fixes issue #346.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  21 Jul 2010 15:30:46 +0200

ietfdb (3.01) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Add a button to issue a ballot for documents which has entered IESG 
    processing but don't have a ballot yet.

  * Always make idinternal.docstate() return a string -- there are callers 
    that assume this, like the script which generates all_id2.

  * Don't fail with a server error (500) if a bad draft name (containing 
    for instance newlines) is entered -- just return a 404.

  * For WG charters under evaluation, show the year too, not only month and 
    day.  This will reveal bad date information in the charter files.

  * If we fail to parse the date of a WG charter under evaluation, use 1 
    Jan 1900, and carry on.  Don't fail with a server error.

  **IESG Datatracker Port to Python/Django**

  * This release adds the IOLA port of the former Perl IESG datatracker to
    the Python/Django datatracker.  This should make most AD actions on
    drafts available through the Django datatracker, normally from the
    datatracker.ietf.org/doc/<draftname>/ page or from the /doc/ad/.../
    page, or expressed UI-wise: from the pages reached from the 'AD Dashboard'
    menu at the top of the lefthand menubar in the datatracker.  This
    includes actions such as:

    - Change draft state
    - Edit draft metadata
    - Defer ballot, undefer ballot
    - Handle ballot comments
    - Handle ballot writeups
    - Approve ballots
    - Initiate last call

    Secretariat staff actions supported through the Django datatracker now
    includes:

    - Manage telechat dates
    - Manage working group descriptions

    Tweaks to the new interface and capabilities will be releases with
    a short release cycle, as they are discovered and fixed over the next
    weeks.

ietfdb (2.52) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Added machine-readable ballot information (tsv and json) for drafts with
    ballots: /doc/<draftname>/ballot.tsv and /doc/<draftname>/ballot.json .
    Json data for the whole document is available for all drafts at
    /doc/<draftname>/doc.json .

  * Added Unicode NFKC normalization of paths.  Somebody just tried to access 
    /wg/ipfix/charter/ with 'fi' represented as the unicode ligature \ufb01...

  * Changed the text emitted during testing to have less noise at the
    beginning of the line -- only 'OK', 'Fail', and the initial line of coverage
    reports now starts at the beginning of the line, without whitespace.  This
    makes it easier to scan a test run visually to find reported failures.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  16 Jul 2010 13:02:46 +0200

ietfdb (2.51) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Add an html sanitizer and a sanitize_html template filter.  This uses
    the html5lib, which has also been included in the svn tree.

  * Provide better handling of both text/plain document comments and 
    document comments which contain html tags.  Adds urlization, 
    linebreak-preservation and html sanitization.  Html sanitization would be 
    better applied when adding comments, but we're not yet a position to 
    enforce this for all input paths.

  * Catch an additional exception which can occur during generation of 
    all_id2.txt

    42 4 \* \* 1 /a/www/ietf-datatracker/web/ietf/bin/notify-expirations

  From Henrik:

  * Adding the south schema migration app (http://south.aeracode.org/).

  * Change the text of IPR search result to more correctly reflect the 
    status of the search result when IPR has been found on documents related to 
    a listed document, but not on that document itself.

  From Pasi:

  * Use the new look for a bunch of additional pages

  * /admin/: fix login redirects to work with RemoteUserMiddleware; hide 
    password changing functionality (which doesn't work with RemoteUser anyway)

  * /ipr/: remove separate list for updating

  * /wg/acronym/\*: clearer warning about concluded WGs

  * A lot of various code and deployment cleanup

  * A lot of minor tweaks and fixes (tooltips, links, and more)

    Requires applying changes to database as follows:

	cd /a/www/ietf-datatracker/2.45/ietf
	PYTHONPATH=../ python manage.py dbshell < ../test/sql_fixup.sql

  * Parse stream/wg/file formats from rfc-index.xml; prepare for parsing 
    auth48 info from queue2.xml

  * IPR disclosures: Don't include .doc/.html inline; don't fail if file 
    does not exist

  * Replaced /drafts/* with redirects

  * Show datatracker version+date in new look, too

  * IESG discuss page: shade even/odd rows

  * Use new look for IETF meeting agenda; add color-coding support (like 
    tools has).  Also use new look for /iesg/agenda/, /ipr/ and /ipr/NNN/
  * Show RFC publication date as YYYY-MM (since we don't currently have the 
    day)

ietfdb (2.44) ietf; urgency=medium

  From Robert:

  * Moved old (1995-2003) liaison statements from the template file
    to the database. This requires applying database fixups as
    follows:

        cd /a/www/ietf-datatracker/2.44/ietf
        PYTHONPATH=../ python manage.py dbshell < ../test/liaison_fixup.sql

    And updating the liaison files as follows:

	cd /a/www/ietf-datatracker/documents/LIAISON/
        # TAKE A BACKUP OF THE WHOLE DIRECTORY, JUST IN CASE
	. /a/www/ietf-datatracker/2.44/test/liaison_fixup.sh

  From Pasi:

  * Use new look for more pages

  * Make obsoletes/updates/etc. lists links (with new urlize_ietf_docs 
    template filter)

  * Always show year in /idtracker/status/ dates

  * /doc/rfcNNNN/: show the internet-draft name (if known) and link to its 
    history; show information about post-RFC IESG processing

  * Use yellow for 'abstain' also in /iesg/agenda/documents/

  * IESG ballot grid icon: show 'abstain' as yellow instead of gray

  * IESG telechat agenda: include "private" links also if logged in, link 
    from document list

  * Added /doc/all/ page

  * Better output if /doc/ search doesn't match anything

  * Show state-change-notice-to field in /doc/ (to AD/secretariat)

  * Added IPR/dependency links and edit/add buttons for RFCs, too; some 
    template refactoring

  * Avoid exceptions from MySQL when searching for non-ASCII draft names/WG 
    acronyms/etc.

  * Handle non-ASCII characters gracefully in old cgi-bin script redirects

  * IPR search: handle non-numeric RFC numbers/ID document tags gracefully 
    (instead of uncaught exception)

  * Change Atom feeds (+couple of other places) to point to /doc/draft-.. 
    instead of /idtracker/draft-.../

  From Henrik:

  * In PersonOrOrgInfo.email(), try harder to find a relevant email address.
    The new code will eventually fall back to a broad filter which matches that
    of the perl code which creates WG charter pages, where the old code would
    sometimes result in django-generated charter pages with missing email
    addresses.

  * Serve ipr disclosures which are available on the server directly, 
    instead of through an external http link in an <iframe/>.  The <iframe/> 
    method can result in mixing https and http content in the page, which some 
    browser take issue with.

  * Add back in rudimentary Django Admin support which was lost in the 0.96 
    -> 1.1 transition.

  * Document page: show IESG telechat date; show state for RFCs (if 
    applicable)

  * Move search button JavaScript to right template file

  * IESG discuss page: better switching between all/by me/for me

  * Less SQL queries for per-document page

  * Moderator package: always show last call end date, fix bug in showing 
    ballot.  Include previous minutes.

  * Show small comment icon (instead of asterisk) when ballot has text.
    Show comment icon also next to discuss/comment text

  * Use a local copy of YUI library instead of pointing to Google CDN (this

  * The 'current agenda' url can fail between meetings, when the 'current 
    meeting number' has been bumped up, but not all relevant information has 
    been entered yet.  Fall back to the most recent meeting for which an agenda 
    can be produced in that case.

  * The self.affiliation() call can sometimes cause an exception, too, due 
    to the deficiencies of the database.  Use something safer as fallback.

  From Pasi:

  * Show various edit buttons only to ADs/secretariat

  * Simplify WG menu a bit

  * Fix comment handling for drafts not in idinternal; use select_related 
    to reduce SQL queries

  * Make sure DOCTYPE is first (without empty lines above it)

  * Use GZipMiddleware for per-document page (result is 25% of original, 
    and loads visibly faster)

  * Close ballot dialog if Escape is pressed

  * Fix ballot dialog not appearing (in new tracker UI)

  * Add timestamp to scribe template

  * Show ballot comments even if AD has no position

  * Improved history tab in "new tracker UI"; per-document page now works 
    better without JavaScript; internal refactoring/cleaning of per-document 
    page

  * Better abstract cleaning (to remove new-style boilerplate)

  * Updated independent submission text to point to RFC 5742 instead of 3932

  * Time out after 30 seconds iwhen downloading

  * Removed unused image (for the already-retired mailing list request tool)

  * Restrict /iesg/agenda/moderator_package.html to ADs and secretariat

        AuthType Basic
        AuthName "IETF Datatracker"
        AuthUserFile /a/www/htpasswd
	Require valid-user

  **IETF 76 Code Sprint**

  * With this release, the datatracker is changed to run under Django 1.1
    rather than under 0.96, and in this sense it is a major release.  There
    is however very few changes that can be seen by the users, which is the
    reason why there is no major bump in the release number.

  Major changes, from Pasi and the code sprint participants:

  * Imported django/ directory from Django-1.1.1.tar.gz, placed in parallel
    with the top-level ietf/ directory in the tree.  This lets us run with
    a version of Django which could possibly be different than the system
    installed version.

  * Automated conversion of the code base to django-1.1 conventions, e.g.
    to use max_length instead of maxlength in model declarations.

  * Lots of escape and safe filters added to the templates, to handle the
    transition from 0.96 to 1.1.  This work was contributed by a number of
    people durint the IETF 76 code sprint::

	Pasi Eronen (also leading up to the IETF 76 code sprint)
	Tony Hansen
	Ben Campbell
	Tero Kivinen
	Adam Roach
	Arifumi Matsumoto

  * Code cleanup, including removal of unused and seldomly used code (in
    particular the code for mailing list change requests)

  * A lot more test cases added, in preparation for the transition to 1.1;
    also refinement of the testing framework.

  From Lars Eggert:

  * Support the use of UTF-8 in emails

  * Fixed the IPR submission tool to work under Django 1.1
