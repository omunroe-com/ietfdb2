# This file controls the datatracker-related cronjobs.  It's intended to be
# symlinked into /etc/init.d/ .  It is a crontab in order to be able to add
# actions which don't fit into the daily or hourly pattern.  It, and daily
# and hourly scripts it triggers, are part of the datatracker repository in
# order to handle cronjob changes that go together with code changes well.
