# it can be noted that the average email address length, calculated over the

Hi,

As part of a review of active and inactive email addresses in the datatracker,
it has been found that your address <%(inactive_email)s>, which is mentioned
in the active draft %(draft_name)s, was set to inactive.

As a consequence of this, it would not be receiving notifications related to
that draft, from the datatracker or through the draft aliases.  The
notifications and aliases would instead have used <%(primary_email)s>.

This most likely was not what you intended when you used <%(inactive_email)s>
in the draft, so that address has now been set to active. The datatracker and
draft aliases will now use it.

If you have a datatracker account, and had manually set the status for
<%(inactive_email)s> to inactive, we apologize for interfering.  Please set it
to inactive again, by using https://datatracker.ietf.org/accounts/profile/. We
don't anticipate changing it automatically again.

If you don't have a datatracker account, then all should be good -- we've
simply set things to be the way they were expected to be.


Best regards,

    Henrik, via the inactive email migration script
