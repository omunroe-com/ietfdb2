<h1>Posting Approved Draft to RFC Editor Failed</h1>

<p>Sorry, when trying to notify the RFC Editor through HTTP, we hit an
error.</p>

<p>We have not changed the draft state or sent the announcement
yet so if this is an intermittent error, you can go back and try
again.</p>

<p>The error was:</p>

<p><code>{{ error }}</code></p>

{% if response %}
<p>The response from the RFC Editor was:</p>

<p><code>{{ response|linebreaksbr }}</code></p>
{% endif %}
