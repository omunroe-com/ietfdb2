   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any
   intellectual property rights or other rights that might be claimed to
   pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in any IETF documents or the extent to
   which any license under such rights might or might not be available; nor does it represent that it has made any independent effort to identify any such rights.
   </p>
   <p>
      There are 3 different IPR disclosures that can be made:
